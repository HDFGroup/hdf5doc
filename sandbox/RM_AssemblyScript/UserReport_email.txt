Subject: Offline copy of the HTML doc for the HDF5 library

Hi,
I would like to have a local copy of the html documentation of the
hdf5 library (v.1.8.5patch1).
I didn't find any doc tarball nor a way to build it from source.

Docs in the svn repository at

https://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/hdf5doc/branches/hdf5_1_8_5

seems to miss the actual description of functions and methods (maybe I
should process them in some way).

Please can you explain me how to get a full working copy of the html
doc or point me to effective instructions to do it?

It seems that a similar problem has been reported on the debian bug
tracking system:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=610866

regards
