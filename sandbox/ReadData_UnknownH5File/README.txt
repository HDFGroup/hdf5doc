Status:
    What Cheryl had in mind at the time of the original conversation with 
    Ruth was an HDF5-focused document, rather than HDF-EOS- or 
    HDF-EOS5-focused (HE or HE5, respectively).  

    Such a document does not, however, appear to be as critical for ESDIS 
    as we at THG had initially thought.  Ten years ago, at the time of the 
    initial EOS satellite and instrument launches, and 4 years ago, with 
    the AURA launch, such documents would have had substantial value, but 
    ESDIS is now an established program and new users are relatively rare.  
    While it's still a worthwhile concept, the need is not as great as it 
    once was.  

    Therefore, though we see substantial value in such documents, THG is 
    reconsidering whether to undertake this specific project at this time.  
    These notes are prepared to capture the ideas, a proposed document 
    outline, etc., that were generated in the course of this and related 
    discussions for the day when this project or a similar one might be 
    undertaken.
