NOTES -- CONVERSATIONS & MEETINGS
=================================


Cheryl [prep]: 27 March 2008
----------------------------

Conversation (at HDF-OES Workshop?) w/Ruth.

What did you have in mind?
    Requirements
    HDF5 .v. HDF-EOS5 data
    HDF5 .v. HDF-EOS5 APIs

    General .v. HDF-EOS-specific data .v. both
        AURA data in HE5 format
        AURA data in H5 format
        Specific other
        Other
        Both/all

Short document 
    First, to see what sort of data you've got:
        h5ls and/or h5dump
    Or to see the structure and visualize/view data
        HDFview

    Second, to extract data for manipulation or further calculation/analysis
    Simple, short, clear [and working!] sample code
        For simplicity, perhaps without "good practices" stuff like error 
            checking
    Perhaps two codes?
        One simple for the logic
        One with error checking, etc
        Both complete enough to coompile and run

    2 to 5 pages, perhaps, of running text 
        With essential illustrations interspersed
            tool (h5ls, h5dump) sample output dumps
            HDFview screen shots
            sample codes
        Plus separate, compilable code files 


Cheryl [conversation]: 27 March 2008, approx 4:05 to 4:40 pm
------------------------------------------------------------

[I sent Cheryl and email to schedule a conversation; she called back as she's
in town through 3/28, then gone for Spring Break, reconstructing hurricane-
damaged homes in Louisiana with her 18-year-old daughter.]

Cheryl does recall the conversation with Ruth, though it took a few minutes.
What she had in mind at the time was an HDF5-focused (H5) document, rather 
than HDF-EOS- or HDF-EOS5-focused (HE).  

Such a document does not, however, appear to be as critical as we had initially
thought.  Ten years ago, at the time of the initial EOS satellite/instrument 
launches, and 4 years ago, at the time of the AURA launch, such documents 
(HE and HE5, respectively, and possibly H4 and H5, respectively) would have 
had substantial value, but ESDIS is now an established program and new users 
are relatively rare.  It's still a worthwhile concept, but the need is no 
longer particularly great.  


------ rough notes transcribed ------
About the document:

It's the setup that trips people up.  E.g., the need to set up plists, memory 
structures, etc.

Beginning users are the target audience for this document; keep it basic.
More advanced topics, such as subsetting, might be mentioned but not 
specifically discussed; a reference to a section in a more complete document 
would be appropriate.
The need for such cross-references might illuminate gaps in existing docs. 
THe goal is to assist in overcoming the hurdles that new HDF5 users face.

Two to 5 pages of running text, physically more pages with figures and code 
examples are inserted.

Structure of the document:

I.    Discovering the contents of a file
      a.  h5ls and h5dump
      b.  HDFview and HDF Explorer [1]
      c.  Just a few tools so as not to overwhelm

II.   Extracting data with H5 calls

III.  Sample codes
      a.  Simple code for the logic and programming models, 
          i.e., without CS-required elements such as error checking.
      b.  More complete code for actual use, including things such as
          error checking.
      c.  Both C and Fortran; in Cheryl's community, at least, "we're all
          Fortran programmers." 
      d.  All codes should compile and run properly.


Notes
-----
[1]  Cheryl reports that she always uses HDF Explorer, rarely HDFview.
