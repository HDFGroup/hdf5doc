NOTES -- CONVERSATIONS & MEETINGS

----------------------------

Conversation (at HDF-OES Workshop?) w/Ruth.

What did you have in mind?
    Requirements
    HDF5 .v. HDF-EOS5 data
    HDF5 .v. HDF-EOS5 APIs

    General .v. HDF-EOS-specific data .v. both
        AURA data in HE5 format
        AURA data in H5 format
        Specific other
        Other
        Both/all

Short document 
    First, to see what sort of data you've got:
        h5ls and/or h5dump
    Or to see the structure and visualize/view data
        HDFview

    Second, to extract data for manipulation or further calculation/analysis
    Simple, short, clear [and working!] sample code
        For simplicity, perhaps without "good practices" stuff like error 
            checking
    Perhaps two codes?
        One simple for the logic
        One with error checking, etc
        Both complete enough to coompile and run

    2 to 5 pages, perhaps, of running text 
        With essential illustrations interspersed
            tool (h5ls, h5dump) sample output dumps
            HDFview screen shots
            sample codes
        Plus separate, compilable code files
