                How to Read the Data from an HDF5 File

                       Notes, Plans, Approach

=================================
NOTES -- CONVERSATIONS & MEETINGS
=================================

Cheryl [prep]: 25 March 2008
----------------------------

Conversation (at HDF-OES Workshop?) w/Ruth.

What did you have in mind?
    Requirements
    HDF5 .v. HDF-EOS5 data
    HDF5 .v. HDF-EOS5 APIs
    General .v. HDF-EOS-specific data .v. both

Short document with clear [and working!] sample code
    For clarity, perhaps without "good practices" stuff like error checking
    Perhaps two codes?
        One simple for the logic
        One with error checking, etc
        Both complete enough to coompile and run
    2 to 5 pages, perhaps, of running text 
        With essential code illustrations interspersed
        Plus code files 


Kent: 18 March 2008
-------------------

Are the targets...?
    Files:  all AURA data
            HDF-EOS5 formats
            or more general
    APIs:   HDF-EOS5
            HDF5

Need to get requirements from Cheryl.
As an ESDIS-paid task, needs to focus on needs identified by Cheryl.
    [Presumably, HDF-EOS5 data and APIs, but we'll see what CC says.]
Project could be broader if it were for general users.

Two elements too task:
    sample program
    documentation

Kent feels that this [is / has the potential to be] a good ESDIS
    task.  And there is some ESDIS money targetted for docs.

Kent will be bretty tied up from now through ESDIS Annual Briefing.
    Will return to work on 3 April.
