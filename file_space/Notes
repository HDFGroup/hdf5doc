Notes related to 'things to do' related to the docs.

- When documentation is complete, identify terms and definitions that should be put into a glossary.

- Make sure relevant related information (such as free space threshholds) is either referenced or documented in this guide.

- Make sure all of the 'guidance' statements in the document are accurate (Ruth added some and isn't an expert).

- Really need another doc that defines what we mean by "raw data" and "file metadata" in full detail.  
It should gives the user a clue about how what they do at the API / data model layers gets translated down 
into those categories.   (and some of those categories may be sub-divided at library implemenation layer)
Then, use same terms all the way from user docs to File Format.  (long term project)

- Not sure how to handle Scenarios / files and refer back & forth. hopefully Frank has some ideas w.r.t. CM.
