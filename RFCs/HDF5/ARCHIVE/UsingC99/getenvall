Hi, I am considering the following change to the PHDF5.
Since you folks are major users of PHDF5, I would like
to see how this may affect you.

=====================================================
The parallel tests sometimes get bitten by mpirun that
does not "forward" environment variables to all MPI processes..
E.g., if one tries
mkdir /pfs/acheng/test$$
setenv HDF5_PARAPREFIX "/pfs/acheng/test$$/"
mpirun -np 3 ...

Not all implementations of mpirun will/can forward the
$HDF5_PARAPREFIX to all mpi processes.  The result is
that different mpi process may have a different value of
what $HDF5_PARAPREFIX is and that often result in hard to
trace errors.

I want to create a collective function
getenv_all(MPI_COMM comm, int root, char *name)
   where process root will make the getenv(envname) and then
   broadcasts the result to all comm processes.

Then in the PHDF library and test programs, all getenv() that
is used by all processes will be replaced by getenv_all().  This
provides an implementation independent of mpirun's ability to forward
environment variables but it also takes away the ability that
an MPI application may want to use different values for the same
environment variable name in different processes. E.g., in some
processes, the PFS is mounted at /scratch but others may be under
the pathname of /net/scratch.

This is pretty rare since such an environment really gives the
MPI users quite a headache.

My questions are two fold:
1) has anyone ever needed to setup the value of an environment
   variable with different values for different MPI processes?
2) Anyone sees any other problem of adopting setenv_all()?

Below is a list of environment variables used by HDF5 library, test
programs and tools.

HDF5_PREFIX             Serial test files prefix. Used by serial tests.
HDF5_PARAPREFIX         Parallel test files prefix. Used by Parallel tests.
HDF5_NOCLEANUP          No cleanup after tests.  Used by both serial and
                        parallel tests.
USER                    Used by serial and parallel tests.
LOGIN                   Used by serial and parallel tests.
srcdir                  Tells where the HDF5 Source directory is.  Used by
                        serial test programs to support --srcdir configure
                        option.
HDF5_DRIVER             Which Virtual File Driver to use. Used by serial tests.
HDF5_MPI_INFO           Setup MPI-IO INFO object. Used by parallel tests.

HDF5_DEBUG              Turn on more library debug tracing. Used by the library.
HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK  Override library version checking. Used by the 
                        library.
H5FD_mpio_Debug         Turn on specific parallel MPIO file driver debug 
                        tracing.  Used by PHDF5 library.
HDF5_MPI_OPT_TYPES      Use MPI type optimization. Used by PHDF5 Library.

COLUMNS                 Used by h5ls.
