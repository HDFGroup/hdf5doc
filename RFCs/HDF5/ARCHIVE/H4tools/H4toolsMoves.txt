H4 related tools to be moved from h5 tree to h4toh5 tree:
   1.	move h4toh5 and h5toh4 tools out of h5tree
   2.	move them to where?

1. Moving h4toh5 and h5toh4 tools out of the hdf5 source
Pros: 
   a)	moving them out h5 tree will help eliminate the need of h5 library dependency of 
	the H4 library.
   b)	Without the dependency, tools using both h4 and h5 library can freely link with 
	any versions of h4 library or h5 library.  But may still have to deal with which zlib 
	library to link.
   c)	Makes h5 library configuration easier.
   d)	The tools can be tested against arbitrary versions of H4 and/or h5 libraries.
Cons:
   a)	The tools will not be tested with the h5 library in daily tests.
   b)	The tools are decoupled with the current changes of h5 library (is already 
	decoupled from the h4 library changes.)
   c)	The tools will not be released with the h5 library code.
Both:
   a)  It may or may not be released with h5 library at the same time.
   b) This may be released as a new product.


2. Moving them to where?
   Let Kent propose a name of the source tree they are going to.


Decisions:
   a)	Do it?  YES.
   b)	Will apply it to both release (1.4) and development branches (1.5).  Not on the 1.2 
	branch.
   c)	Bill and Kent will do it.
   d)	Should the tool pages of h4toh5 and h5toh4 be moved from h5tree to the new 
	tree?  To be decided later.


Will post the above discussion to hdf5dev for comments.  Will proceed the move if no 
big objections come up by next Wednesday.
