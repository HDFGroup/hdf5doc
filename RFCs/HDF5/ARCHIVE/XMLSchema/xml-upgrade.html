<h2>XML Upgrade for h5dump</h2>
Robert E. McGrath<br>
April 3, 2003<br>
<br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The HDF5 DTD and h5dump --xml option have been stable since 2001. It is time
to update these products to keep up with current standards and tools. &nbsp;This
note explains two relatively small changes that should be implemented immediately.
<br>
<br>
<h3>1. Creating an HDF5 XML Schema</h3>
The XML Schema language is considerably more powerful and flexible than the
DTD language, and many new tools (including the ESML from UAH) are using
schema. The most important XML software (e.g., Apache Xerces (used by IBM)
and XMLSpy) support both DTD and schema, so there is no loss of function
moving to schema, and much to be gained.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Fortunately, it is technically possible to create a schema that precisely
matches our current DTD, which means that the same dumper output can be validated
with XMLschema with only trivial changes (see below). &nbsp;In fact, the
XML Spy tool automatically generates a schema from a DTD. &nbsp;I have used
this tool to create a schema that is equivalent to the DTD, which is on the
web at:<br>
<blockquote><a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.xsd">http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.xsd</a>.<br>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Required Changes to the Dumper</h3>
The dumper output (h5dump --xml) can be used with the schema developed above,
with one simple change to the first few lines of the output. &nbsp;The change
is necessary to inform the parser how to parse the file.<br>
<br>
The DTD version is:<br>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>&lt;!DOCTYPE HDF5-File PUBLIC "HDF5-File.dtd" "http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.dtd"&gt;<br>&lt;HDF5-File&gt;<br></pre>
For schema, these lines must be replaced with:<br>
<pre><br>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>&lt;HDF5-File <br>  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" <br>  xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.xsd"&gt;<br></pre>
The rest of the output can be identical.<br>
<br>
To implement this change requires changes to a few lines of the h5dump.c.
It is desirable for the schema to be the default output, so we should add
a new option to output the old DTD when needed. &nbsp;So I propose the following
changes to the invocation of the dumper:<br>
<pre><br></pre>
<blockquote>
  <pre>!      -x, --xml            Output in XML using Schema (default)<br>!      -u, --use-dtd            Output in XML using DTD<br>!      -D U, --xml-dtd=U    Use the DTD or schema at U</pre>
</blockquote>
  The '--xml' &nbsp;option is changed to output the preamble for the 'schema'
instead of DTD. A new option, tentatively called '-u' will override the schema
and produce the same output as the current default. &nbsp;The '-D' option
specifies a particular file or URL to use as the DTD or schema. &nbsp;Currently
this is always a DTD. (This value cannot be checked by the dumper, it is
up to the user to specify the correct value.)<br>
<br>
<h3>3. Desired changes to the dumper</h3>
In the process of checking the schema it became apparent that the newer XML
parsers are much more thorough than what we used two years ago: &nbsp;they
found several minor bugs inthe DTD and one major error in the output of the
dumper.<br>
<br>
The major error is as follows: in the DTD we give each 'top level' object
(Group, Dataset, etc.) an XML tag (in the DTD, type ID). Cross references
are made in other XML tags (e.g., a Dataset points to the Groups it is a
member of), these tags are type IDREF. &nbsp;These tags are used only by
the XML parser and XML based software, they have no meaning outside the specific
XML document. In the current version of the dumper, we fill these tags with
a full path for the object, and earlier parsers were content.<br>
<br>
However, XML has several strict requirements on these tags:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Each ID must be unique within the file</li>
  <li>The ID is required to &nbsp;follow the production rule:&nbsp;<br>

    <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-Name">Name</a></code><code>&nbsp;</code>&nbsp;::=&nbsp;<code>(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-Letter">Letter</a> | '_' | ':') (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-NameChar">NameChar</a>) *</code></li>
</ol>
Our path names are unique, but are rejected because they have '/' and can
have other prohibited charaters. As a result, the output of the dumper is
rejected by strict parsers, even though it is perfectly correct otherwise.<br>
<br>
<h4>Proposed solution</h4>
There might be several solutions. &nbsp;<br>
<ul>
  <li>We could eliminate these tags altogether.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We could work out some sort of swizzling algorithm to escape all the prohibited charaters</li>
  <li>We could create ID's not based on paths.</li>
</ul>
It seems a shame to remove a feature that may be useful in the future, so I looked at how to generate legal values.<br>
<br>
Since the legal names are quite restricted compared to HDF5 names, the swizzling would have to be quite extensive.<br>
<br>
The suggested approach is to generate unique identifiers using object ID's,
e.g., xid_nnnn-nnnn. &nbsp;These are unique, and have at least some relation
to the HDF5 file, and are already available in the dumper--they are used
as keys in the table of paths used to generate the ID strings.<br>
<br>
There were two gothcha's encountered.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Soft links are objects in the data model and the XML model, but have no object id.</li>
  <li>Objects with more than one link to them appear in the XML multiple
times, each record needs a unique ID (although the record is actually a pointer
to the object).</li>
</ol>
These problems were dealt with by creating fake object ids for softlinks,
and disambiguating the ID in the XML when needed. &nbsp;These are very simple
algorithms.<br>
<h4>Required changes</h4>
Basically, every place where the value of an ID or IDREF is generated, the
code has to be changed from 'xml_escape_the_name(path)', to call 'xml_name_to_XID(path)'.
The new routine creates a string of the format 'xid_%ld', with the object
id or a fake object id. There are about 20 places in the code to be fixed.
&nbsp;These changes are isolated in code dedicated to XML, they do not affect
the normal output.<br>
<br>
In three places, the object may be a duplicate, in which case the output
is: 'xid_%ld-%d', where the last number is incremented each instance.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
These changes are the same for schema or DTD.<br>
<br>
To illustrate the basic change, consider original XML output for a Dataset and its containing groups:<br>
<pre>   &lt;Group Name="g1" OBJ-XID="/g1" Parents="/" &gt;<br>      &lt;Group Name="g1.1" OBJ-XID="/g1/g1.1" Parents="/g1" &gt;<br>         &lt;Dataset Name="dset1.1.1" OBJ-XID="/g1/g1.1/dset1.1.1" Parents="/g1/g1.1"&gt;</pre>
In the new algorithm, the XML would be:<br>
<pre>   &lt;Group Name="g1" OBJ-XID="xid_1344" Parents="xid_696" &gt;<br>      &lt;Group Name="g1.1" OBJ-XID="xid_2968" Parents="xid_1344" &gt;<br>         &lt;Dataset Name="dset1.1.1" OBJ-XID="xid_4968" Parents="xid_2968"&gt;<br></pre>
The difference is in the 'OBJ-XID elements and the 'Parents' elements which point to an OBJ-XID.<br>
<br>
In the case of objects with more than one link, the original output looked something like:<br>
<br>
<pre>   &lt;Dataset Name="dset1" OBJ-XID="/dset1" Parents="root"&gt;<br>      &lt;!-- ...description omitted /&gt;<br>   &lt;/Dataset&gt;<br>   &lt;Group Name="g1" OBJ-XID="/g1" Parents="/" &gt;<br>      &lt;Dataset Name="dset2" OBJ-XID="/g1/dset2" Parents="/g1"&gt;<br>         &lt;DatasetPtr OBJ-XID="/dset1"/&gt;<br>      &lt;/Dataset&gt;</pre>
where /g1/dset2 is a hard linkt to /dset1. &nbsp;Note that /g1/dset2 needs
a unique OBJ-XID, but it is really the same object as /dset1 so it has the
same HDF5 object id. &nbsp;In the new XML, this is disambiguated with an
additional counter:<br>
<pre><br>   &lt;Dataset Name="dset1" OBJ-XID="xid_744" Parents="xid_696"&gt;<br>      &lt;!-- ...description omitted /&gt;<br>   &lt;/Dataset&gt;<br>      &lt;Group Name="g1" OBJ-XID="xid_1804" Parents="xid_696" &gt;<br>      &lt;Dataset Name="dset2" OBJ-XID="xid_744-1" Parents="xid_1804"&gt;<br>         &lt;DatasetPtr OBJ-XID="xid_744"/&gt;</pre>
So, the Dataset pointer (/g1/dset2) has an XML id based on the HDF5 object
id of the dataset it points to (xid_744) with '-1' appended. &nbsp;Subsequent
appearances of the same object would have a different integer added. &nbsp;(This
is implemented by a counter that gives a new number for each such collision.)<br>
<br>
As noted above, Softlinks have no object id. A fake ID is created for each
Softlink. &nbsp;In the original XML a softlink would be something like:<br>
<pre>   &lt;SoftLink LinkName="slink1" Target="somevalue" TargetObj="/somevalue" OBJ-XID="/slink1" Source="root"/&gt;<br></pre>
The new version has a fake object ID for the OBJ-XID:<br>
<pre><br>   &lt;SoftLink LinkName="slink1" Target="somevalue" OBJ-XID="xid_18446744073709551614" Source="xid_696"/&gt;<br></pre>
The fake object id is generate starting from HADDR_MAX and counting down
by one for each subsequent link. &nbsp;This will eventually collide with
a real object id, but it is unlikly that XML (or the dumper) will encounter
such a case.<br>
<h3>Revisions to the test ouput</h3>
The test output will need to be modified to match the new output.<br>
<h3>Revisions to documentation</h3>
Some documentation will need to be updated. This has not been investigated. &nbsp;<br>
<h3>Changes to the h5gen program (the reader)</h3>
The XML parsing needs minor modifications to work with the new Xerces. &nbsp;This
is not very difficult, and works with schema with minimal changes.<br>
<br>
The <i>h5gen</i> program was written to use the old Java object model, it
will need to be rewritten to use the new object model. This is a big project
which is not considered here. <br>
<br>
Without this tool, we have no way to generate HDF5 from XML.<br>
<h3>Other Changes Related to XML</h3>
We will probably want to add new features to the XML Schema in the future. &nbsp;These include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>new objects such as 'image', 'table', 'palette', and 'dimension'</li>
  <li>use of pawerful features of XML schema, such as mappling XML datatypes to HDF5 datatypes</li>
  <li>incorporation of ideas from XDF or similar array definition languages to mark up data elements</li>
  <li>implementing pointers (extended URLS) to objects in the binary HDF file</li>
</ul>
This document does not consider these or other possible enhancements. <br>
