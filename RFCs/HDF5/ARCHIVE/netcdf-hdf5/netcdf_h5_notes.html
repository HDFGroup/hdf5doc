<h2>Strawhorse: NetCDF to HDF5 mapping</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
This note sketches some preliminary ideas on how netCDF4 should be mapped
to HDF5. This is intended as a model for the kind of abstract mapping I believe
we need to create, and as a starting place. &nbsp;It is <i>not</i> intended as a final statement on any design issue.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In earlier work, a basic design was proposed [Yeager 99]. This note
follows the earlier work, with some important modifications.<br>
<br>
The overal goal is to define a standard layout for netCDF objects in HDF5. The underlying assumptions are:<br>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;the netCDF4 profile will implement extensions of the netCDF3
programming model, storing and retrieving data from HDF5 objects.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In some cases, there may be additional HDF5 objects in the file, i.e.,
not created or managed by the netCDF4 layer. In this case, software that
conforms to the netCDF4 profile should ignore the objects.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The netCDF4 layer may need to store and retrieve objects besides the
user-defined data objects, e.g., tables to index all the netCDF variables
in the file.</li>
</ol>
<h3>General layout of the HDF5 File</h3>
At the global level, one approach is to segregate all the 'netCDF' objects--i.e.,
the objects defined by the netCDF profile and&nbsp; managed by the netCDF
layer-- in one or a few conventional diretories. The rule would be:<br>
<ul>
  <li>all netCDF objects will appear in these areas</li>
  <li>only netCDF objects will appear in these areas</li>
</ul>
If an application wants to create additional (non-netCDF objects), it is
free to do so, but should place them outside the netCDF groups.<br>
<br>
As an initial suggestion, the netCDF objects should be stored under two HDF5 groups:<br>
<ul>
  <li>/netCDF -- the user defined data</li>
  <li>/netCDF.meta -- objects for internal use of the netCDF layer</li>
</ul>
So, when the calling program creates a variable, it will be stored in an
HDF5 Dataset under /netCDF. If the netCDF library needs to store a table,
e.g., of all variables in the file, it will be stored in an HDF5 dataset
under /netCDF.meta.<br>

<h3>Mapping of netCDF objects to HDF5 objects</h3>
Fundamentally, a netCDF variable can be stored as an HDF5 dataset. Table 1 shows the main concepts.<br>
<br>

Several issues are open:<br>
<br>
1. A convention must be established for naming <br>
<br>
HDF5 Datasets are identified by path names, so it would be possible to store
a variable named 'foo' as an HDF5 Dataset named '/netCDF/foo'. If the variable
is renamed, the dataset would be renamed.<br>
<br>
The semantics of netCDF variable names may require auxilliary data structures,
e.g., to keep track of the order that variables are define, and to cycle
through them in order.<br>
<br>
2. Dimension scales<br>
<br>
HDF5 has not completed a design for dimension scales. The ultimate implementation will support netCDF dimensions.<br>
<br>
However, as in the case of variables, the netcDF&nbsp; semantics of dimension names may require additional data structures.<br>
<br>
3. Datatypes<br>
<br>
HDF5 datatypes are a superset of netCDF data types, so it will be necessary to define what will be used.<br>
<br>
HDF5 can store the data in native format or a standard layout. NeCDF3 has
specified a single storage format. It will e necessary to specify what netCDF4
should do.<br>
<br>
4. Data<br>
<br>
HDF5 has a rather different storage model than netCDF, so some of the semantics
will need to be defines. In particular, the desired storage for unlimited
dimensions needs to be definded.<br>
<br>
To support unlimited dimensions, the HDF5 dataset must be chunked. &nbsp;The specification will need to define<br>
a default chunking strategy.<br>
<br>
<h3>Data Access Operations</h3>
Reading and writing data from/to a variable maps to equivalent HDF5 operations
for datasets. In general, there is a natural correspondence, although the
APIs and programming models are different.<br>
<br>

<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>netCDF</b><br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top"><b>HDF5</b><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">put_var..., etc. for partial write, read<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">H5Dwrite, etc., <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">&nbsp; &nbsp;partial write/read<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">&nbsp; &nbsp; selections<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">_FillValue, nc_set_fill<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">Dataset creation properties<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">nc_set_fill (fill behavior)<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">Dataset creation properties<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
HDF5 support alternative storage methods (AKA 'file drivers'), e.g., memory
files, split files, etc.. These will work transparently for netCDF4 if they
are specified.<br>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<br>
NetCDF attributes map naturally to HDF5 attributes. HDF5 has no reserved
attributes (e.g., for units), we may want to add the netCDF conventions to
HDF5 as part of the spec..<br>
<br>
As in the case of Variables/Datasets, HDF supports many more datatypes than netCDF.<br>
<br>
<h3>Programming model</h3>
The netCDF programming model may require storing additional attributes and/or
indexes. What ever persistent global (to the library or file/dataset) state
is needed will need to be mapped to some HDF5 object.<br>
<br>
<h4>managing id's</h4>
NetCDF and HDF5 use ID's to reference open objects, but the models are not
identical. Also, netCDF has functions to access by ID and to discover IDs
of objects. &nbsp;It may be necessary or desirable to create indexes of objects,
and it may be necessary to store these in the file. &nbsp;So, even though
the ids and indexes are not part of the stored file per se, there may be
some stored objects for netCDF4 library internal data.<br>
<h4>'define mode'</h4>
HDF5 has no equivalent of the netCDF 'define mode'. &nbsp;It will be necessary to determine what the behavior of the library must be.<br>
