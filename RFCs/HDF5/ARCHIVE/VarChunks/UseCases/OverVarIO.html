<A NAME="Creation">
<H3><U>Client Desires to Efficiently Write Overlapping Differently-Sized Data Selections from Each Process:</U></H3>
</A>

<U>Pre-conditions:</U>
<UL>
    <LI>File is opened by client.
    <LI>Dataset is opened by client.
</UL>

<U>Scenario:</U>
<OL>
    <LI>Client gets file dataspace for dataset.
    <LI>Client defines a differently-sized hyperslab selection for the dataspace
        in each process.  Ideally, these align exactly with one chunk in the
        dataset.
    <LI>Client defines memory dataspace for I/O operation.
    <LI>Client defines a selection in the memory dataspace.
    <LI>Client creates a dataset transfer property list (DXPL).
    <LI>Each client sets the "target chunk" for its data in DXPL.
    <LI>Client writes data to dataset, using the DXPL and selections in the
        file and memory dataspaces defined above.
</OL>

<U>Notes:</U>
<OL>
    <LI>A "target chunk" is the chunk that all the data for the I/O operation
        should be written into.  A target chunk's value must be one of the
        following values:
        <UL> <DL>
            <DT>The ID of a valid chunk.
            <DD>If a target chunk is a chunk ID,
                then the elements of the file selection must be a subset of
                the elements in the chunk, or the I/O operation with fail.
            </DD>
            <DT>The value "H5P_TARGET_CHUNK_LOWEST"
            <DD>If a target chunk is set to the value "H5P_TARGET_CHUNK_LOWEST",
                then each
                element is written to the chunk with the lowest chunk ID that
                contains that element.
            </DD>
            <DT>The value "H5P_TARGET_CHUNK_HIGHEST"
            <DD>If a target chunk is set to the value
                "H5P_TARGET_CHUNK_HIGHEST", then each
                element is written to the chunk with the highest chunk ID that
                contains that element.
            </DD>
        </DL> </UL>
    <LI>See <A HREF="../EfficientIO.html">this</A> page for a description of
        how this scenario efficiently transfers variable-sized chunks.
