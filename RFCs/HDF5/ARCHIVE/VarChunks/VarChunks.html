<DL>
    <DT><STRONG>What is this document about?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>This document describes ideas for introducing a new method
            of efficiently storing raw data for an HDF5 dataset in certain
            special cases described below.
        </DD> <BR>
    <DT><STRONG>What is currently supported?</STRONG></dt>
        <DD>Currently we require all chunks for a dataset to have three major
            requirements: that they are identical in shape (# of dimensions and
            the dimension sizes), they are non-overlapping and they are
            "regular" in their shape.  "Regular" shaped chunks are essentially
            N-dimensional rectilinear blocks.  Here's an example of
            non-overlapping, identical, regular shaped chunks:
            <CENTER> <TABLE>
            <TR><TD><IMG src=Regular_AppView.gif>
            <TR><CAPTION align=bottom>Regular, non-overlapping, identical chunks</CAPTION>
            </TABLE> </CENTER>

            <P>[Note - Should we expand this support to allow for overlapping
                regular, identical chunks?]
            </P>
        </DD> <BR>
    <DT><STRONG>What areas do we want to expand chunking support in?</STRONG></dt>
        <DD>We would like to expand support for chunked datasets to allow
            chunks for a dataset to not be all the identical size.
            Additionally, it would be desirable to support chunks that are
            irregularly shaped and overlapping other chunks.
        </DD> <BR>
    <DT><STRONG>Why do we want to expand chunking support?</STRONG></dt>
        <DD>Our customers would like to be able to
            have different sized pieces of a dataset in different processes
            and to write out each of those pieces in one I/O operation, see the
            discussion of 
            <A HREF="EfficientIO.html">Efficient I/O</A>.
            Additionally they would like to store multiple dataset elements in
            each coordinate location.
        </DD> <BR>
    <DT><STRONG>What are "variable-sized" chunks?</STRONG></dt>
        <DD>"Variable-sized" chunks are "regular" shaped chunks that have the
            same number of dimensions, but each may have different sizes.
            Here's an example of non-overlapping, variable-sized regular chunks:
            <CENTER> <TABLE>
            <TR><TD><IMG src=Irregular_AppView.gif>
            <TR><CAPTION align=bottom>Regular, non-overlapping, variable-sized chunks</CAPTION>
            </TABLE> </CENTER>

            <P>Here's an example of overlapping, variable-sized, regular
                chunks:
            </P>
            <CENTER> <TABLE>
            <TR><TD><IMG src=Overlap_AppView.gif>
            <TR><CAPTION align=bottom>Regular, overlapping, variable-sized chunks</CAPTION>
            </TABLE> </CENTER>
        </DD> <BR>
    <DT><STRONG>What are "irregular" chunks?</STRONG></dt>
        <DD>"Irregular" chunks are chunks that can have any shape, including
            holes and discontinuities, although they all still must have the
            same number of dimensions.  "Irregular" chunks are by definition
            "variable-sized" chunks.
            Here's an example of non-overlapping, irregular chunks:
            <CENTER> <TABLE>
            <TR><TD><IMG src=Hyperslab_AppView.gif>
            <TR><CAPTION align=bottom>Irregular, non-overlapping chunks</CAPTION>
            </TABLE> </CENTER>

            <P>Here's an example of overlapping, irregular chunks: (see
            <A HREF="SideBar1.html">this</A> page for a view of the individual
            chunks for this diagram)
            </P>
            <CENTER> <TABLE>
            <TR><TD><IMG src=HyperLap_AppView.gif>
            <TR><CAPTION align=bottom>Irregular, overlapping chunks</CAPTION>
            </TABLE> </CENTER>

<LI><H3><U>Use Cases:</U></H3>

<P>The desire to add support for variable-sized (including irregularly shaped)
and/or overlapping overlapping chunks comes from a number of use cases. ("client"
in all these use cases could be either another library (such as SAF or UDM) or
an application)

<LI><H3><U>Potential Problems:</U></H3>

<P>Clients who have discontiguous variable-sized chunks on disk may find that
the library orders their data in <A HREF="Discontig.html">suprising ways</A>.
</P>

<P>Defining chunks one at a time allows to the possibility that there are
elements in the dataset's dataspace which are not <A HREF="Uncovered.html">
covered by any chunks</A>.
</P>
