<P>As clients build up the chunks for a dataset, they may leave certain
elements uncovered in the dataset's dataspace.
<CENTER> <TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG src=Uncovered1_AppView.gif>
<TR><CAPTION align=bottom>Uncovered, variable-sized chunks</CAPTION>
</TABLE> </CENTER>
<BR>
</P>

<P>This is not a problem for storing the chunk information, but it can be
a problem if the client attempts to access elements not stored in any existing
chunks.
</P>

<P>For example, if each process chose to operate on rectangular selections in
the dataset:
<CENTER> <TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG src=Uncovered1_Selected.gif>
<TR><CAPTION align=bottom>Uncovered, variable-sized chunks, with selections that access uncovered elements</CAPTION>
</TABLE> </CENTER>
<BR>
What should happen when reading or writing to elements that are not covered by
any chunks?
</P>

<P>Some potential solutions:
<OL>
    <LI>Don't allow datasets to be created with uncovered elements.  This will
	probably be a problem when a dataset's dataspace is extended.
    <LI>Don't do any I/O, just return an error from HDF5 calls that
	attempt to access elements not in any chunks.
    <LI>Define a "background" chunk that contains all uncovered chunks.
    	This is a problem when a chunk is defined later that covers an element -
	how to access the elements that have been covered?
    <LI>Treat uncovered elements as a "black hole" on writing and as the
        "fill value" when reading.
</OL>
