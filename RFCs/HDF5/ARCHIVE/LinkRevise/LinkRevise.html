<DL>
    <DT><STRONG>What is this document about?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>This document describes some enhancements to the information
            stored for each link in an HDF5 group.
        </DD> <BR>

    <DT><STRONG>How do links in HDF5 groups currently operate?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>
            <P>Links in HDF5 groups are the method that indicates an object's
                inclusion in a group.  Objects in HDF5 files don't
                have names themselves (due to being able to be included in
                multiple groups with different names), so the link to the object
                has a name for that particular reference to the object.
            </P>
            <P>Fundamentally, links store certain required information,
                such as the name of the link and either the object header
                address in the file (for hard links) or the target name (for
                soft links).  Additionally, hard links can cache certain
                additional information about the target object (such as it's
                B-tree root and local heap addresses, for group objects) in
                an attempt to speed up operations on that object.
            </P>
            <P>Currently, the information for each link in a group is split into
                two pieces.  A fixed size portion is stored in the
                <A HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html#SymbolTableEntry">group node entry</A>,
                and the name is stored in the
                <A HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html#LocalHeap">local heap</A>
                for the group.
            </P>
            <P>Links in a group are indexed by a
                <A HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html#Btrees">B-Tree</A>,
                where the B-tree keys are the names of the objects (using the
                offset of the name in the local heap) and leaf nodes of the
                B-tree point to 
                <A HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html#SymbolTable">group nodes</A>,
                which contain lists of 
                <A HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html#SymbolTableEntry">group node entries</A>.
            </P>
        </DD> <BR>

    <DT><STRONG>What are limitations of the current design?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>
            <P>Over time, we've learned more about how HDF5 groups are used
                and have determined a few limitations in the current design.
                One difficulty is the way the B-tree and local heap addresses
                are cached for groups.  Because the empty B-tree and local heap
                are allocated for each new group (in order to put them into the
                cached information for the new link to that group), if the
                group remains empty, the space used by the B-tree and local
                heap is wasted.  It would be better to allocate the B-tree and
                local heap on demand, when links are created in an empty group.
            </P>
            <P>Additionally, the information about each link
                is split into two locations (the group node entry and the
                local heap) in a way which wastes space for linking to common
                objects, like datasets.  The information about each link also
                includes "cached" information about the object linked to, which
                breaks the modularity of the design.
            </P>
            <P>Also, each time the B-tree is traversed, the local heap must be
                mapped into memory, in order to compare the names of the links.
                It would be possible to avoid this penalty by creating a
                hash-value of each name to store in the B-tree keys and avoid
                touching the local heap at all during B-tree traversals.
            </P>
        </DD> <BR>

    <DT><STRONG>How are object references and group links related?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>
            <P>Object references in datasets point to other objects in an
                HDF5 file.
                Object references are stored in datasets as an address of the
                object referenced.  They are similar in this respect to the
                way hard links are stored (hard links also directly store the
                address of the object linked to).  However creating an object
                reference to an object <EM>doesn't</EM> increment the reference
                count of the target object, which allows an object reference
                to "dangle" like a soft link.
            </P>
        </DD> <BR>
</DL>

<LI><H3><U>New Requirements:</U></H3>

<P>There are several new requirements listed here, in order of decreasing
importance:
    <UL>
        <LI>Support a "creation ordering" in a group.  Multiple applications,
            including netCDF-3/4 require a mechanism for accessing linked
            objects
            in the order they were created.  netCDF in particular requires a
            way to get the n<SUP>th</SUP> object in a group, according to
            the order the links were created, ideally as fast as locating
            a link by its name.  Supporting this fast lookup would require
            adding a B-tree to the group which was indexed according to the
            creation order.  (Note that this is about the
            creation <EM>order</EM>, not the creation <EM>time</EM>.)
        <LI>Reduce the amount of space taken by an empty group.  Several
            HDF5 customers, including Boeing, are using empty groups as
            "place holders" to attach attributes to.  Having these 
            groups allocate space for empty B-trees and local heaps can
            waste enormous amounts of space.  (This may belong better in the
            "suggested changes" section, since we don't have explicit
            funding for this effort)
    </UL>
</P>

<LI><H3><U>Additional Suggested Changes:</U></H3>

<P>Since we are planning to revise the format of the links, there are several
other changes that would be beneficial to make at this time.  Suggested changes
are listed here:
    <UL>
        <LI>Unify the information about a link.  Since we need to access the
            local heap in order to retrieve the name on a link, all the
            information for a link should be stored in the local heap.  This
            will allow the information stored for each link to be smaller and
            more flexible as well as possibly vary in size.
        <LI>Allow more information to be stored about a link.  We need to allow
            creation order information to be added to links, for netCDF-3/4
            support.  How about certain other predefined information about
            each link, such as the creation time, etc?
        <LI>We should allow link names to be stored with non-ASCII
            character sets, such as Unicode.  Probably all the links in a
            group should be stored with the same character set though, so the
            actual character set chosen should probably be stored at a higher
            level.
        <LI>If links are more of a "real" object, we can change object
            references to use links instead of the current format.  Links
            as object references in a dataset would be stored in a local heap
            for the dataset.  We would have to decide whether to keep object
            references the way they are now (pointing to an object like a
            hard link, but not incrementing the target's reference count like
            a soft link), or change them to be closer to the way hard or soft
            links in groups operate.
        <LI>If links are particular objects that can be referenced from anywhere
            in the file (as offsets in a local heap at a particular address),
            we can add back-pointers to HDF5 files.  This would be done by
            adding a list of "back-pointers" to each HDF5 object, each
            of which referred to the link that pointed to the object.  This
            would allow
            file compaction to be performed much more easily than without
            back-pointers.  It may also allow browsers to more easily traverse
            and present objects in a file.
        <LI>If links are closer to a "real" object, we can allow attributes to
            be added to them.  The attributes on links would allow the links
            to be colored or weighted by graph traversal routines that used
            HDF5 links and groups to describe a graph.  Possibly, the
            attributes on a link could be treated as additions to the
            attributes on the target object by an application, allowing
            different sets of attributes to be seen on an
            object, depending on the path taken to arrive there.
        <LI>Change the default format for B-tree keys to a hash-value, to
            speed up name lookups in the B-tree.  This would also have the
            advantage of avoiding comparing names encoded with different
            character sets during B-tree traversal.  Of course, the downside
            is that the order of the objects iterated with this B-tree would
            appear in random alphabetical name order.  This could be addressed
            by adding an additional B-tree to track the alphabetical ordering,
            if a user desired.

<LI><H3><U>Suggested Changes:</U></H3>

<P>To accomodate the requirements above, changing the prototype of the
"overflow" callback is necessary, as well as attaching it to a data transfer
property list and changing the library's behavior for the return values of
the callback.  I would also suggest changing the name from an "overflow"
callback to the more generic "type conversion exception callback".
</P>

<P>After accomodating the changes above, the prototype would look like this:
    <pre>H5T_conv_ret_t (*H5T_conv_except_func_t)(H5T_conv_except_t exception_type,
        hid_t src_id, hid_t dst_id, void *fill_buf, void *src_buf, void *dst_buf,
        void *user_data);</pre>
</P>

<P>The parameters are as follows:
<UL>
    <LI><CODE>exception_type</CODE> - The type of exception (enum described
        below).
    <LI><CODE>src_id</CODE> - A datatype ID describing the source datatype.
    <LI><CODE>dst_id</CODE> - A datatype ID describing the destination datatype.
    <LI><CODE>fill_buf</CODE> - A pointer to the fill value for this dataset, or NULL if
        no fill value is defined.
    <LI><CODE>src_buf</CODE> - A pointer to the buffer containing the source value.
    <LI><CODE>dst_buf</CODE> - A pointer to the buffer where the destination value should
        be placed.
    <LI><CODE>user_data</CODE> - A pointer to the "user data" set by the application that
        registered the conversion callback.
</UL>
</P>

<P>The <CODE>H5T_conv_except_t</CODE> enumerated type has the following values:
<UL>
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_RANGE_HI</CODE> - The source value is greater
        than the range of values that can be encoded in the destination value.
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_RANGE_LO</CODE> - The source value is less than
        the range of values that can be encoded in the destination value.
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_PRECISION</CODE> - The source value will suffer a
        loss of precision when it is represented in the destination type.
        (This generally occurs when very large integers are converted to
        floating-point types)
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_TRUNCATE</CODE> - The source value will suffer a
        truncation in value when it is represented in the destination type.
        (This generally occurs when floating-point values with fractional
        values are converted to integer datatypes)
</UL>
</P>

<P>The return value from conversion callbacks is <CODE>H5T_conv_ret_t</CODE>,
a new enumerated type with the following values:
<UL>
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_ABORT</CODE> - Abort type conversion immediately (-1).
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_NOT_HANDLED</CODE> - Conversion callback did not
        handled the conversion exception and the HDF5 library should perform
        whatever default conversion it normally applies (0).
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_HANDLED</CODE> - Conversion callback 
        handled the conversion exception and the HDF5 library should
        <EM>not</EM> perform whatever default conversion it normally applies (1).
</UL>

<LI><H3><U>Discussion:</U></H3>

<P>With the above changes to the library, the datatype conversion code will be
able to fulfill all the new requirements listed.  Supporting the new type
conversion exception callback and detecting the new exception types (loss of
precision and truncation) will require some additional coding, but not a huge
amount.  Adding support for detecting the new exception types will make the
int &lt;-&gt; float conversions slightly slower and more complex though.
</P>

<P>A weakness in the changes proposed above is that there is no way to set
the fill value for a "direct" memory buffer datatype conversion (i.e. calling
H5Tconvert() directly, instead of the datatype conversion occurring during the
process of accessing data in a file).  I would suggest not worrying about this
and internally passing NULL for the fill value pointer during application calls
to H5Tconvert() until we get requests from users to enable this feature.  At
that point, we can revise the H5Tconvert() API routine.
</P>
