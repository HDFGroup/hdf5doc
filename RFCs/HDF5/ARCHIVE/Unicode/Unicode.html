</align><h2>UTF-8 Character Encoding in HDF5</h2>

</align><h5>Motivation</h5>
<p>The NetCDF team would like HDF5 to support strings with UTF-8 Unicode character encoding.<br>
</p>
<p>  Currently HDF5 officially supports only strings encoded in standard US ASCII.  However, the HDF5 <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html">Format Specification </a>and other documentation is ambiguous, and the library does not check the encoding of strings.</p>


<h5>What is UTF-8?</h5>
<p>Joel Spolsky has written an introduction to character sets and Unicode entitled <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets</a>.</p>

<p>Briefly: standard ASCII defines characters for byte values between 0 and 127.  Values 128 through 255 are <b>not defined</b>
by standard ASCII.  UTF-8 byte values between 0 and 127 represent the same
characters as ASCII--standard ASCII is a subset of UTF-8.  ASCII values 128-255
represent different characters depending on which "code page" is currently
loaded.  UTF-8 also uses these values to represent characters outside of
unaccented American English.</p>

<p>The convenient side-effect of this is that any UTF-8 string is also a
valid ASCII string, although not necessarily one with the same meaning. 
Any string consisting of only standard ASCII characters (unaccented American
English characters) is identical in ASCII and UTF-8 encodings.</p>

<p>UTF-8 does store some characters as multiple bytes (up to four bytes);
all multibyte characters use byte values of 128-255.  NULL-termination, space
padding, and C string routines all operate identically on UTF-8 as they do
on ASCII characters and strings.  The fact that UTF-8 has mutibyte characters
means that the number of bytes in a string is not necessarily the number
of characters in that string, but the number of bytes is usually the important
factor for storing and manipulating the string.</p>

<p>The ASCII and UTF-8 must be displayed differently for characters outside
of the standard ASCII set, but this is the responsibility of the displaying
software, not of HDF5.  ASCII and UTF-8 strings can be stored and manipulated
identically by HDF5.</p>

<h5>Proposed action to investigate further:</h5>
<p>   Write tests to ensure that UTF-8 characters can be used in the library.
 The tests would ensure that strings including non-ASCII characters don't
break any functionality, and can be returned to the user unaltered.  This
would need to be tested everywhere the library uses character strings,. Table
1 gives a list of where strings are used in the HDF5 API.<br>

<h5>What would UTF-8 support mean?</h5>This document assumes that the tests
will confirm that using UTF-8 will not break the HDF5 API or library. If
so, these tests can be checked in to CVS if appropriate.<br>
<br>
Adding support for UTF-8 has several aspects.<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Adding means for the user to set and retrieve a character encoding for all the cases in Table 1 that we cover.</li>
  <li>Adding a new encoding to the character encodings for a String datatype (first row)</li>
  <li>Checking the validity of UTF-8 encoded strings, when UDF-8 is selected (optional?)</li>
  <li>Updating the Format Specification to correctly specify the use of US ASCII, extended ASCII, and UTF-8.</li>
  <li>Documenting the correct use of UTF-8, and backward compatibility issues with existing files and applications.</li>
</ol>
An important design decision is which objects in Table 1 will support alternative
encodings, and what granualarity will they be specified.<br>
<br>
Data values (i.e., data of type String) are easy to handle via  a  simple
extension of the current data types. As currently, the HDF5 library would
not check the encoding of user data values.<br>
<br>
A simple option is to have a single file creation property that selects ASCII
or UTF-8 for the whole file (except for data values).  Whichever is selected
applies to the whole file. <br>
<ul>
  <li>Advantages:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>simple</li>
    <li>feasible</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Disadvantages:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>inflexible, especially for future if additional encodings are added</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Finer grained control is more difficult because only a few operations have
property lists that can be used to specifcy the encoding, at lease without
changing the existing APIs. How this could be done is an open question.<br>
