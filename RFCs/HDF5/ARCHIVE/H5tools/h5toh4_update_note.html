<h3>Summary of HDF5 to HDF4 mapping</h3>
HDF5 supports two primary objects<br>
<ol>
  <li>	Groups</li>
  <li>	Datasets</li>
</ol>
<br>
	Only HDF5 datasets and groups and their attributes can have HDF4 counterparts.
 &nbsp;All other HDF5 objects should be assumed to have no HDF4 counterpart.
 For &nbsp;instance, the HDF5 "named  datatype" object has no HDF4 counterpart.
Certain <br>
	HDF5 datasets, attributes and groups also have no HDF4 counterpart.  These include:<br>
	<br>
<ul>
  <li>	Any HDF5 dataset or attribute whose datatype is not equivalent to
an HDF4 datatype.  HDF4 datatypes include unsigned and signed 8-, 16-, 32-
and 64-bit integers, and 32- and 64-bit IEEE floats.  </li>
  <li>	Datasets with datatypes of multiplicity greater than 1, unless they map to Vdatas.</li>
  <li>	Any HDF5 object whose size is greater than 2^31-1.</li>
  <li>	Any HDF5 attribute that is associated with an HDF5 dataset whose HDF4 counterpart is a palette.</li>
  <li>	Any HDF5 soft link that does not point to a corresponding HDF4-compatible object.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<br>
<h4>	A. GROUPS</h4>
	HDF5 groups map to HDF4 Vgroups by default. <br>
<br>
<h4><i>Attributes of Groups</i></h4>
If the HDF5 file was originally	converted from an HDF4 file (using h4toh5),
an HDF5 group may have attributes with names prefixed by "HDF4_VGROUP_ATTR_".
&nbsp;These attributes are written to the HDF4 Vgroup after stripping off
the prefix. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)<br>
<br>
	All other attributes are written to the HDF4 Vgroup without any change.<br>
<br>
<h4><i>The HDF5 root group</i></h4>
<br>
	The HDF5 root group is a special case. HDF5 has a strictly single rooted
tree structure, whereas HDF4 supports a forest structure (can have two or
more disconnected trees).  In the current version of <i>h5toh4,</i> the HDF5 root group is mapped to a corresponding HDF4 Vgroup, &nbsp;with all HDF4
objects descending from that group. In essence, this is a 'dummy' (of no
use) group as far as the HDF4 file is concerned. <br>
	<br>
In the new version of <i>h5toh4,</i> by default, the HDF5 root group is removed
from the file after all the root group attributes are processed. For maintaining
the behaviour of the previous implementations, there is an option to override
the default mapping. <br>
<br>
<h4><i>Attributes of the Root Group</i></h4>
<br>
	In both cases, the HDF5 root group attributes are processed in the same
manner. &nbsp;Global attributes are set as attributes of the corresponding
interface. &nbsp;Attributes suffixed with GLO_SDS are written as global to
the SD interface. Similarly, attributes suffixed with GLO_GR are written
as global to the GR interface. <br>
<br>
	In case of an HDF5 input file originally converted from an HDF4 file, there
may be HDF4 file annotations (file labels and/or file descriptions) written
as &nbsp;HDF5 root group attributes with the name HDF4_FILE_LABEL&lt;n&gt;
for a file label <br>
	and the name HDF4_FILE_DESC&lt;n&gt; for a file description. These attributes are recreated as HDF4 file annotations. <br>
<br>
	All other root group attributes are written as HDF4 file descriptions with
the value "HDF5_&lt;AttributeName&gt; = &lt;AttributeValue&gt;"<br>
<br>
	It should be noted that the root group attributes are processed, even if
the &nbsp;'do not suppress' root group option is specified, but the attributes
are not removed from the dummy vgroup. <br>
<br>
<h4>	B. DATASETS</h4>
	HDF5 datasets can represent SDS, GR Images, palettes and Vdatas. If there
is no metadata to indicate which particular HDF4 object, the HDF5 dataset
corresponds to, an HDF5 dataset with an HDF4-compatible scalar datatype is assumed to be an HDF4 SDS.<br>
<br>
<h4><i>	HDF5 Image Dataset to HDF4 GR Image</i></h4>
	Image data is stored as an HDF5 dataset with values of HDF5 class Integer or Float. The HDF5 Image specification (<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/ImageSpec.html">http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/ImageSpec.html</a>: Section 1) defines certain standard attributes for an Image dataset. <br>
<br>
	The HDF5 dataset for an image is distinguished from other datasets by giving
it an attribute "CLASS=IMAGE". A HDF5 dataset with this attribute name-value
pair is converted into an HDF4 GR Image.<br>
		<br>
	In addition, the HDF5 Image dataset may have an optional attribute "PALETTE"
that is an array of object references for zero or more palettes. However,
HDF4 supports only one palette per image. Only the first object reference
from the <br>
	array of object reference is converted into a corresponding HDF4 palette
and set as the default palette for the particular image. In the current implementation,
other palettes are discarded WITHOUT warning.<br>
<br>
	The HDF5 Image dataset may have an optional attribute "INTERLACE_MODE" that
specifies the layout of the data for images with more than one component
for each pixel. The value "INTERLACE_PIXEL" maps to MFGR_INTERLACE_PIXEL"
in HDF4. The value "INTERLACE_PLANE" maps to "MFGR_INTERLACE_COMPONENT" in
HDF4. If the attribute is not defined, the default value is assumed to be
"INTERLACE_PIXEL".<br>
<br>
	Apart from these attributes ("CLASS", "PALETTE", "INTERLACE_MODE"), all
other standard attributes defined by the Image Specification are written
to the HDF4 GR Image with the attribute names prefixed with "HDF5_". <br>
	<br>
	If the HDF5 Image dataset was created from an HDF4 GR Image (using h4toh5),
the dataset may contain attributes with names prefixed by "HDF4_IMAGE_ATTR_".
These attributes are written to the HDF4 GR Image by stripping off the prefix.
(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)<br>
<br>
	The HDF5 Image dataset may have additional non-standard attributes (not
defined in the Image Specification) to describe the image. These attributes
are written to the HDF4 GR Image without any change.<br>
<br>
<h4><i>	HDF5 Palette Dataset to HDF4 Palette</i></h4>
	Palette data is stored as an HDF5 dataset with values of any HDF5 atomic
numeric type. &nbsp;The dataset will have dimensions (nentries by ncomponents),
where 'nentries' is the number of colors (usually 256) and 'ncomponents'
is the number of values per color (3 for RGB, 4 for CMYK, etc.). <br>
<br>
	The HDF5 Palette Specification (<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/ImageSpec.html">http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/ImageSpec.html</a>: Section 2) defines certain standard attributes for a Palette dataset. <br>
<br>
	The HDF5 dataset for a palette is distinguished from other datasets by giving
it an attribute "CLASS=PALETTE". As mentioned in section 4.B.a, an HDF5 Image
Dataset may have an attribute "PALETTE" that is an array of object references
for zero or more palette datasets, each of which has an attribute "CLASS=PALETTE".
The first object reference in <br>
	the array corresponds to the default pallete and is converted into an HDF4
palette and attached to the GR Image. All other palette datasets in the array
are discarded WITHOUT warning in this implementation.<br>
<br>
	Apart from this attribute (CLASS), all other standard attributes defined
by the Palette Specification are written to the HDF4 GR Image as palette
attributes (Tag value: "DFTAG_LUT") with the attribute names prefixed with
"HDF5_". (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)<br>
<br>
	If the HDF5 Image dataset to which the HDF5 Palette dataset corresponds
to, was created from an HDF4 GR Image (using h4toh5), the dataset may contain
attributes with names prefixed by "HDF4_PALETTE_ATTR_". These attributes
are written to the HDF4 GR Image as palette attributes (Tag value: "DFTAG_LUT")
by stripping off the prefix. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)<br>
<br>
	The HDF5 Palette dataset may have additional non-standard attributes (not
defined in the Palette Specification &amp; not prefixed by "HDF4_PALETTE_ATTR")
to describe the palette. These attributes are written to the HDF4 GR Image
as palette attributes (Tag value: "DFTAG_LUT") without any change. (NOT IMPLEMENTED
YET)<br>
<br>
<h4><i>	HDF5 Table Dataset to HDF4 vdata</i></h4>
	Table data is stored as an HDF5 one dimensional compound dataset. The HDF5 Table specification &nbsp;(<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/hdf5_hl/doc/RM_hdf5tb_spec.htm">http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/hdf5_hl/doc/RM_hdf5tb_spec.htm</a>l) defines certain standard attributes for a table dataset. <br>
<br>
	The HDF5 dataset for a table is distinguished from other datasets by giving
it an attribute "CLASS=TABLE". A HDF5 dataset with this attribute name-value
pair is converted into an HDF4 vdata.<br>
	<br>
	Apart from this attribute (CLASS), all other standard attributes defined
by the Table Specification are written to the HDF4 vdata with the attribute
names prefixed with "HDF5_". <br>
<br>
	The HDF5 table dataset may have additional non-standard attributes (not
defined in the Table Specification) to describe the table. These attributes
are written to the HDF4 vdata without any change. <br>
<br>
<h4><i>	Other HDF5 Dataset mappings</i></h4>
	For any other dataset (not covered in sections above), the conversion is the same as in the current tool.<br>
<br>
* If the datatype is an HDF4-compatible scalar datatype, it is converted to an HDF4 SDS. <br>
<br>
If the HDF5 dataset was converted from an HDF4 dataset (using h4toh5), then
it may contain attributes with names prefixed by "HDF_SDS_ATTR_". These attributes
are written to the HDF4 SDS after stripping off the prefix. (NOT IMPLEMENTED
YET)<br>
<br>
	    All other attributes are written without any change.<br>
	<br>
	  * If the datatype is one dimensional compound, it is converted to an HDF4 vdata.<br>
<br>
<h3>"Reversibility" Features, Not Implemented Yet</h3>
Many attributes are created by the <i>h4toh5</i> utility or library, which are given special names to identify the original HDF4 object. &nbsp;Ideally, the <i>h5toh4</i>
tool should "reverse" the conversion, and convert these into an HDF4 annotation
or attribute resembling the original. &nbsp;Table 1 lists cases that have
been identified but not implemented yet.<br>
