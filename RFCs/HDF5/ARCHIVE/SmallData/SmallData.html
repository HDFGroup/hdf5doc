    <dt>What Is a Block Allocation Mechanism?</dt>
        <dd>
            <P>A block allocation mechanism is a method the library uses to
            group "small" objects together, in order to increase I/O
            performance.  The small objects can often be accessed together in
            less read or write calls.
            </P>
            <P>This is currently implemented in the HDF5 library by a "metadata
            block aggregation" algorithm which allocates a fixed-size block for
            "generic" metadata, and then preferentially sub-allocates small
            metadata allocations from that larger block.
            </P>
        </dd>
    <dt>What Is "small data"?</dt>
        <dd>
            <P>"Small data" is the "raw" dataset data stored in the file that is
            "small".  "Small" in this case means it is similar in size to the
            typical size of metadata stored in the file.  [Normally, this tends
            to be around 200-300 bytes in size.]
            </P>
        </dd>
    <dt>Why Add a "small data" Block Allocation Mechanism?</dt>
        <dd>
            <P>
            When the size of raw data for datasets is on
            the same order as the size of metadata in the file (or smaller), the allocation
            behavior of the raw data is similar to that of the metadata in the
            file and benefits from the same block allocation algorithm.
            The metadata in a file is already handled by a block allocation
            mechanism, but the "small data" in the file would benefit from
            a separate block allocation mechanism.
            An API function is provided
            to adjust the fixed-size block for "small data" up or down from its
            default setting of 2KB.
            </P>
        </dd>
    <dt>Will Adding a "small data" Block Allocation Mechanism Hurt "large data" I/O?</dt>
        <dd>
            <P>No.  This block allocation mechanism is only used when raw data
            is small enough to fit into the current allocation block.  Raw data
            that is larger than the space available in the block is allocated
            within the file in the normal manner.
            </P>

    <dt>HDF5 Applications Which Create Small Datasets</dt>
        <dd>This feature primarily benefits applications which create many
            small datasets in a file.  
</dl>
                                                                 
<li><h3><u>Design Goals & Requirements:</u></h3>

    <li>Improve I/O speed of files with many small datasets.</li>
    <li>Don't reduce the speed of any other I/O.</li>
    <li>Impact the v1.5 branch's APIs in as minimal way as possible.</li>
</ul>
                                                                 
<li><h3><u>Proposed Changes and Additions to Library Behavior:</u></h3>

<P>This proposed change adds a block allocation mechanism for "small data" in
the file to the library.  This is done in a manner nearly identical to the
metadata block allocation mechanism in the library, which operates as follows:
    <dl>
        <dd>When space for metadata is requested, the block allocator checks if
            the space requested is small enough to fit into it's current block.
            If the block is sufficiently large, the space is sub-allocated from
            the block and the information about the block is updated.  If the
            space requested is larger than the space remaining in the current
            block, but smaller than the block's initial size, the remaining
            space in the block returned to the file's free list, a new block
            is allocated and the requested space is sub-allocated from the new
            block (and the information about the block is updated).  If the
            space requested is larger than the block's initial size, space is
            allocated specifically for the new metadata and the block is
            unchanged.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</P>

<P>The "small data" block allocation mechanism would operate in the same
fashion, although operating on raw data instead of metadata.
</P>

<li><h3><u>API Changes Required:</u></h3>

<P>Adding this mechanism to the library requires a pair of "get/set" property
list functions to adjust the initial block size of the block used to
sub-allocate "small" raw data from.
</P>

<li><h3><u>Alternate Approachs and Other Enhancements:</u></h3>

<P>It might be useful to specify more than one size of block to sub-allocate out
of, i.e. a block for allocation less than 2KB, another block for allocations
from 2-64KB, etc., up to the final limit on the blocks where allocations above
the limit at allocated directly from the file.  Due to the way free space in the
file is handled currently, this may be a bad idea though...
</P>

<li><h3><u>Parallel I/O Repercussions:</u></h3>

<P>None.  We require all space allocations in a file to be performed
collectively, so all processes will make identical decisions about allocating
from the "small data" block or from the file directly.
</P>

<li><h3><u>Forward/Backward Compatibility Repercussions:</u></h3>

<P>Backward compatibility is the ability for applications using the HDF5
library to compile and link with future versions of the library.
Forward compatibility is the ability for applications using the 
HDF5 library to compile and link with previous versions of the library.
</P>

<P>Adding this change has no forward or backward compatibility issues, since it
is only adding new API functions and the behavior of current API functions does
not change.

<li><h3><u>File Format Changes:</u></h3>
<P>None.
</P>
                   
<li><h3><u>API Functions Added:</u></h3>
