<br>
Robert E. McGrath<br>July 7, 2004<br>
<br>
<b>Overview</b><br>
<br> HDF5 files may have arbitrary user data at the front of the file. &nbsp;The
user block is ignored by the HDF5 library, the HDF5 file is logically identical
whether it has a user block or not.<br>
<br>
The size of the user block can be set as a file creation property, which
can be read to discover if a user block is present. The HDF5 library has
no other functions on the user block. <br>
<br>
At
this time, there are no tools to put or get a user block for an exiting
file. In the future, we might impolement features to read or add suer blocsk to tools such as h5repack and h5dump. <br>
<br>
This RFC presents a proposal for two simple new utilities to add and remove the user block from an <i>existing HDF5 file</i>. These tools can be used with any HDF5 file.<br>
<br>
The goal of these utilities is to provide an easy way to  to add and remove the user block from an <i>existing HDF5 file</i>. These tools may or may not work well for some files, e.g., HDF5 files not stored in a single file.<br>
<br>
<b>Principle of Operation</b><br>
<br>An HDF5 file with a user block has three parts:<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>the user block data (can be anything, text or binary)</li><li>pad of space up to 512, 1024, etc.</li><li>the HDF5 file, beginning with the HDF5 header.</li>
</ol>
Given an exsiting HDF5 file, it is necessary to create a new file (or rewrite
the existing file) with the user block, optional padding, followed byd the
exact image of the HDF5 file.<br>
<br>
Removing a user block reverses this operation: The HDF5 file is rewritten, to start at byte 0.<br>

<dl><dt><strong>Tool Name:</strong> jam<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unjam<br>

</dt><dt><strong>Syntax:</strong>
    </dt><dd><code>jam -u user_block -i in_file.h5 [-o out_file.h5] [-clobber]</code></dd><dd><code>jam -h</code></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><code>unjam -i in_file.h5 </code><code>[-u user_block | --delete] [</code><code>-o out_file.h5]</code></dd><dd><code>unjam -h</code></dd></dl>
<dl><dt><br>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong>
    </dt><dd>Add user block to front of an HDF5 file, to create a new concatenated file.&nbsp;</dd><dd>Split user block and HDF5 file into two files, user block data and HDF5 data.</dd><dd><br>
  </dd><dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    </dt><dd><code>jam</code>&nbsp; concatenates
a <code>user_block</code> file and and HDF5 file to create an HDF5 file with a user block. The user
block can be any test (binary or text). &nbsp;The output file is padded so
that the HDF5 header begins on byte 512, 1024, etc.. &nbsp;(See the HDF5 File
Format.)<br>
</dd></dl>
<blockquote>
  <dl><dd>If <code>out_file.h5</code> is given, a new file is created with the <code>user_block</code> followed by the contents of<code> in_file.h5. </code>In this case,<code><big> </big>infile.h5 </code>is unchanged.<br>
      <br>
If <code>out_file.h5</code> is not specified, the&nbsp;<code>user_block</code> is added to<code> in_file.h5</code>. &nbsp;</dd><dd><br>
    </dd>
    <dd>If in_file.h5 already has a user block, the contents of <code>user_block</code> will be added to the end of the existing user block, and hte file shifted to the next boundary. If <code>-clobber</code> is set, any existing user block will be overwritten. <br>
    </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<dl><dd>
    <p><code>unjam</code><code></code> splits an HDF5 file, writing the
user block to a file or stdout and the HDF5 file to an HDF5 file with a header at byte
0 (i.e., with no user block).</p>
  </dd></dl>
<blockquote>
  <dl><dd>If <code>out_file.h5</code> is given, a new file is created with the<code></code><code> in_file.h5 </code>without <code></code>the user block.<code> </code>In this case,<code><big> </big>infile.h5 </code>is unchanged.<br>
      <br>
If <code>out_file.h5</code> is not specified, the&nbsp;<code>user_block</code> is removed and <code>in_file.h5</code> is rewritten, starting at byte 0.<br>
      <br>
If <code>user_block</code> is set,the user block will be written to <code>user_block</code>.&nbsp; If <code>user_block</code> is not set, the user block (if any)<code></code> will be written to stdout. If <code>-delete</code> is selected, the user block will not be not written.</dd></dl></blockquote>
<dl><dt><strong>Example Usage</strong></dt></dl>
<blockquote>Create new file, <code>newfile.h5</code>,&nbsp; with the text in file <code>mytext.txt</code> as the user block for the HDF5 file <code>file.h5</code>.<br>
  <blockquote><code>jam -u mytext.txt -i file.h5 -o newfile.h5</code><br>
  </blockquote>
Add text in file <code>mytext.txt</code> to front of HDF5 dataset, <code>file.h5</code><code></code>.<br>
  <blockquote><code>jam -u mytext.txt -i file.h5 </code><br>
  </blockquote>
Overwrite the user block (if any) in <code>file.h5</code> with the contents of <code>mytext.txt</code>.<br>
  <blockquote><code>jam -u mytext.txt -i file.h5 --clobber</code><br>
  </blockquote>
For an HDF5 file, <code>with_ub.h5</code>,&nbsp; with a user block, extract the user block to <code>user_block.txt</code> and the HDF5 file to <code>wo_ub.h5</code>.<br>
  <blockquote><code>unjam -i with_ub.h5 -u user_block.txt -i wo_ub.h5</code><br>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>


<dl><dt><br>
<strong></strong></dt><dt><strong>Return Value</strong></dt></dl>
<blockquote><code>jam</code> returns the size of the output file, or -1 if an error occurs.<br>
  <br>
  <code>unjam</code> returns the size of the output file, or -1 if an error occurs.<br>
</blockquote>
<dl><dt><strong>Caveats</strong></dt><dt><strong></strong><br>
  </dt><dt>This
tool copies all the data (sequentially) in the file(s) to new offsets. &nbsp;For
a large file, this copy will take a long time.</dt><dt><br>
  </dt>
  <dt>The most efficient way to create a user block is to create the file
with a user block (see H5Pset_user_block...&lt;&lt;link&gt;&gt;), and write
the user block data into that space from a program.<br>
  </dt>
  <dt><br>
  </dt>
  <dt>The user block is completely opaque to the HDF5 library and to the jam
and unjam tools. &nbsp;The user block is simply read or written as a string
of bytes, which could be text or any kind of binary data. &nbsp;It is up
to the user to know what the contents of the user block means and how to
process it.</dt>
</dl>When the user block is extracted, all the data is written to the output, including any padding or unwritten data.<br>
<br>
This tool moves the HDF5 file through byte copies, i.e., it does not read or interpret the HDF5 objects.<br>
