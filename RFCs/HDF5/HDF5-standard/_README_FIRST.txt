The PDF documents on this site have been tested and display properly in 
dedicated PDF viewers such as Adobe's Acrobat Reader and Apple's Preview.

They may not, however, display properly in some other environments.  
If you open one of these files through a web browser and find that some 
text is displayed oddly (e.g., text is printed above or below the line 
or in a smaller-than-reasonable typeface) or an image is displayed as a
black rectangle, save the file to your local disk and open it in a PDF 
viewer such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or Apple Preview.

If the file still displays improperly, contact Frank Baker at 
fbaker@hdfgroup.org.
