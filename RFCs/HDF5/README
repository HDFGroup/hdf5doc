This directory is for documents being proposed for which comments are
requested.

Files in this directory are temporary in nature.  Finalized versions should
reside in some other appropriate permanent directory.

All documents should be deposited in their own directories, and NOT as
.html files right inside the RFC/ directory.

All documents should contain a last modified date.  
Any documents older than 3 months are considered obsolete and should be 
removed.  They will be placed in the ARCHIVE/ directory and eventually moved 
to mass storage and deleted.
