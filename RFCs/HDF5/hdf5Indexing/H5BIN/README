FILES:
	Makefile: Used to compile the source code.
	include:
		bitmap.h: contains the implementation of a bitmap index using disk arrays.
		bitvector.h: contains the implementation of a WAH compressed bit vector.
		exceptions.h: contains the exceptions used.
		H5BIN.h: contains a wrapper over the bitmap.h implementation to use HDF5
		instead of disk arrays.
		Types.h: Defines types.
	lib: The index library, once built, lies in this directory.
	obj: The intermediary object files lie in this directory.
	src:
		bitvector.C: contains the actual implementation of a WAH compressed bit
		vector.
		H5BIN.C: contains an example of how to use the API.
	test:
		metadata.h5: Contains an example metadata file.
		data: This directory contains the datasets described by the metadata.h5
		file.

COMPILING:
	In the Makefile modify the HDF variable so that it points to the directory
	that contains the HDF5 installation.
	Then run make. Requires make tool and HDF5 to be installed.

Using the index:
	To create an new index for the example:
		./index -c test
	To query the index
		./index -q test [lb] [ub]

To use the API please look at the Users Guide at
