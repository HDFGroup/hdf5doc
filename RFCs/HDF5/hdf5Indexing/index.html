<p><font face="Arial Black">When Kepler formulated his famous laws of planetary 
motion, he was using data painstakingly gathered by his mentor Tycho Brahe to 
advance science. With today's advances in sensor, automation, and computation 
technologies, gathering scientific data has become very easy. Large data sets 
produced by observation or simulation allow scientists to formulate new theories 
and to test existing theories against actual data. This ability has led to 
production and consumption of large amounts of data by scientists. For example, 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey currently offers twelve terabytes of data, which is 
being used by scientists across the world to study astronomical phenomena and 
discover new heavenly bodies. Looking at the earth instead of the sky, the Earth 
Observing Satellite system from NASA produces 3 terabytes of data per day. While 
these are both observational data, simulation data sets do not lag too far 
behind the observational data in terms of size. Each complex run at the Center 
for Simulation of Advanced Rockets at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign produces a couple of terabytes of data. Future scientific 
applications will be even more data-intensive, due to improved 
observation-gathering technology and more complex and larger-scale simulation 
codes. To extract information from such large amounts of data, scientists need 
to be able to pull out arbitrary subsets of these large data sets based on 
various constraints; this task requires efficient data management techniques, 
including a good indexing scheme.</font></p>
