<FONT SIZE=4><P>Mike, </P>
<P>Peter and I have put together a "to do" list from our old list and new requests and ideas. You may have yet more items that we haven't thought of yet. We have not prioritized the activities yet. We'd like you to look this over and the three of us can discuss more detailed priorities. </P>
<P>The list is organized into 6 groups: </P>
<OL TYPE="A">

<LI>Ongoing Maintenance &amp; development </LI>
<LI>Completed, but we need feedback (e.g., does ESDIS like the plot features?) </LI>

<LI>Remote access/JHS/ etc. </LI>
<LI>Requested features, including Doug Ilg's list </LI>
<LI>Requested but not currently promised </LI>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><LI>Cannot generate a spreadsheet from an SDS. In Collage, this was the "native" depiction of SDSs.</LI>
<LI>There are too many image windows employed. Their purposes are not very clear. Maybe some simple labels would make this more understandable.</LI>
<LI>Spreadsheet shows numbers as if they were floats, regardless of type. Since spreadsheets are always from raster images and they are usually integers, this is a bit confusing/annoying.</LI>
<LI>Similarly, many of the higher level objects are represented as folders. This makes obvious another level of hierarchy that is hidden by the HDF interfaces. Maybe a different icon (instead of a plain folder) for these compound or complex "objects" would make things clearer here.</LI>
<LI>SDSs are displayed both as whole "objects" (as SDSs) and in their full gory detail (as collections of stuff under Vgroups). Very confusing.</LI>
<LI>Field plots from Vdatas are nice, but adding some scaling options would be good. I can think of three options: </LI></OL>

<LI>group - all plots scaled together to fit the window </LI>
<LI>constrained group - all plots scaled according to one user selected plot, which has been scaled to fit window. </LI>
<LI>individual - each plot scaled independently to fit window (easier to see dynamic range of each field - check DIAL plots) </LI></UL>

<LI>"Radial Plots" is a misnomer for non-polar images.</LI>
<LI>Vertical plots should be possible.</LI>
<LI>When operations are performed on an un-zoomed image, no effects are seen in the zoomed area. Either an update button or a toggle for continuous update would be nice.</LI>
<LI>After loading a largish attribute, the cursor doesn't revert to normal until the mouse is clicked (it stays an hourglass).</LI>
<LI>The title of the tree panel reads "Hierarchy of the HDF." Expanded, this would read "Hierarchy of the Hierarchical Data Format." I think you really mean to say "Hierarchy of the HDF file."</LI>
<B><LI>Feature request #137: </B>Could JHV display the dimension scale values rather than the pixel values, for raster grids, such as when moving the mouse cursor over an image in the "Image from HDF" dialog? </LI>
<B><LI>Feature request #156: </B>Allow JHV to read in a palette description. </LI>
<B><LI>Feature request, not numbered yet: Deal with Vdata entries order &gt; 1<BR>
</B>Following is a response from the user regarding the order in a vdata, and what JHV should show. I kind of agree with him. Could we use a scroll bar, as he suggested, to view all the values?<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The reason we would like to use jhv is to check the HDF files that we write. <BR>
&gt;Therefore, we would like to see all entries. By the way, what is the point of <BR>
&gt;fixing the maximum number of entries displayed to 3 in such a highly dynamic <BR>
&gt;language like java? If it doesn't fit in the window, you could just put <BR>
&gt;scrollbars around it. </LI>

Improve the selection of sub sets from browse images, especially large and 3D SDSs.</LI></OL>
