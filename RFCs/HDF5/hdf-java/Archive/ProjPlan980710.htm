<B>Phase 1: prototype development</B>

<P><B>Goal:</B> Design and implement a prototype, review prototype
to create final design.

<P>It should be noted that this project must be completed during the summer
session of 1998. It should also be noted that the programmer must
learn the JHV and HDF in this period. Therefore, it cannot expect
to implement all the requirements described in the <A HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/internal/Java_HDF/Plans/Spreadsheet/requirements.html">requirements
document</A>.

<P>The first priority will be providing a spreadsheet that has most of
the features of the current spreadsheet, none of the bugs, and a much better
interface. Complex new features, such as modification of data
may be too difficult to complete in this short time period.

<P>The main activities are listed below, with specific deliverables, which
will be scheduled as milestones.

<B>Phase 2: Integration and test</B>

<P><B>Goal: </B>Revise prototype, create final code, integrate into
source base, complete documentation and test for release.

<P>At the beginning of Phase 2, we will determine the features to be included
in the release, and work out a more detailed schedule for integration and
release.

<P>The strategy is to freeze development of the new spreadsheet on 1 August,
and conduct a detailed status review. This review will determine
what will be included in the September release.
