\begin{abstract}
There has long been interest in having first-class support for half-precision floating-point and complex
number datatypes in HDF5 to better facilitate applications that work with these types of data. This RFC
discusses adding support for these datatypes, as well as a few other convenient datatypes, to the HDF5
library.
