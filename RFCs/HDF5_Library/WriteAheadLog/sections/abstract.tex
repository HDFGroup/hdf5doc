\begin{abstract}
This RFC describes a new module that implements a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for metadata within the HDF5 library. In the event of a crash during the lifetime of an application using HDF5, this WAL can be used by the library or an external tool to restore the metadata within an HDF5 file to a self-consistent state, preventing file corruption and limiting the loss of application data with minimal I/O and memory overhead.
