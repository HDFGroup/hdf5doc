<a name="Intro">
<h3>4.1. Introduction</h3>
</a>
  
  <p>The core strengths of HDF5 are the capacity to handle large amounts
  of complex data and the flexibility to manage that data efficiently. The 
  building blocks that give an HDF5 file its capacity and flexibility are 
  groups and datasets. Datasets will be described in the next chapter. In 
  this chapter, groups will be described, and since links are 
  closely intertwined with groups, links will also be discussed.</p>
  
  <p>Groups and links can be used to arrange data in a meaningful way. 
  For example, objects (groups or datasets) that are used together can 
  be grouped together. Data that comes from similar sources might also be 
  grouped together. </p>
  
  <p>When groups are nested, they create a hierarchy. This 
  hierarchy is similar to the tree structure employed on UNIX file 
  systems using directories and files and on Apple Macintosh and 
  Microsoft Windows systems using folders and files. HDF5 groups are 
  analogous to the directories and folders; HDF5 datasets are analogous 
  to the files.</p>

  <p>The structure of an HDF5 file can also be compared to a geographic 
  map. Cities and towns are like datasets. They come in a wide variety of 
  configurations. Roads are like links that help us get to datasets. 
  Countries, states, and counties are like groups: they help us place 
  the cities and towns where we live and work. </p>


<!--
1.4.2011, The second paragraph above sets up the comparison between an 
HDF5 file and a file system directory tree structure. Would a map analogy 
work better? You have cities and towns of various sizes and complexities
that are joined by roads. Cities as datasets, and roads as links. 
Countries and states as groups. I added a draft paragraph above which 
can join or replace the tree structure paragraph.

<h3 class=pagebefore>4.2. Defining Groups and Links</h3>
</a></a>

  <p>Groups and links provide the way for application programs to navigate 
  to datasets. A <em><b>group</b></em> contains a collection of links. 
  A <em><b>link</b></em> is a connection between a group and an object. When we 
  use the term link, we mean a connection between a group and an object 
  that is unidirectional, has a single source, and has a single target. 
  </p>
  
  <p>The purpose of this section is to describe the basic characteristics 
  of groups and links. </p>
  
  
  
  

<a name="Groups">
<h4>4.2.1. Groups</h4>
</a>

  <p>A group contains a collection of links. If we could peer inside a group, 
  we would see a list of the links that are the members of the group. </p>
  
  <p>Groups do not have names. When we speak of a group, we use the name 
  of the link that is connected to the group. </p>
  
  <p>Groups are used to organize objects. If we were organizing our data 
  by year, we might set up groups for 2010, 2009, and 2008 data. To do this, 
  our file might have three links named 2010, 2009, and 2008 in the root 
  group. The groups that are the targets of these three links might have 
  links to datasets that hold our data.</p>
  
  <p>To work with groups, application programs use the Groups interface. 
  The names of the function calls in this interface start with H5G.</p>
  



  
<a name="TheRootGroup">
<h4>4.2.2. The Root Group</h4>
</a>

  <p>When a file is created, a group that we call the root group is 
  created. The root group is the designated starting point for access 
  to objects in the file.</p>
  
  <p>There is no name for this group just as there is no name 
  applied to any object. When we write about the root group, when we 
  need to specify the root group in a parameter, we use a 
  slash, <code>/</code>. </p>
  
  <p>Every group is created with a hard link. The hard link that is 
  created with the root group is a variation of a regular hard link. 
  The root group's hard link does not have a name and cannot be changed. 
  This means the root group cannot be deleted. See the 
  <a href="#HardAndSymbolicLinks"> &ldquo;Hard and Symbolic Links&rdquo;</a> 
  section for more information. Another variation of a regular hard 
  link is described in the <a href="#AnonymousGroups">&ldquo;Anonymous 
  Groups&rdquo;</a> section below.</p>
  
  
  
  
<a name="LinkPaths">
<h4>4.2.3. Link Paths</h4>
</a>

  <p>A link is a connection or association between a group and an object. 
  A group is the source of the link, and the object is the target of the 
  link. </p>

  <p>Every link has a name, and no object has a name. When 
  we talk about an object, we might call the object by the link's name. 
  Suppose a group has a link named Y1, and the target of Y1 is a 
  dataset. If we refer to the dataset as Y1, what we really mean is 
  the dataset that is the target of the link called Y1. See the figure 
  below. </p>
  
  <p>As more data is added to our file, we can nest datasets within 
  groups and groups within groups. As we add links to groups, we need 
  to remember that link names need to be unique within each group. </p>
  
  <p>To navigate to a group or dataset, we combine the links to the group 
  or dataset into a <em><b>link path</b></em>. Link names can be used in 
  more than one place as long as the link paths are unique.</p>
  
  <p>A link path can be absolute or relative. An absolute 
  link path starts at the root group. A relative link path starts 
  from some other known position such as a currently open group. </p>
  
  <p>A link path looks like a path name in a file system tree structure. 
  Each link name is separated from another link name by a slash, 
  <code>/</code>. The link name following a slash is always a member of 
  the group that is the target of the link name preceding that slash. 
  For example, in the link path <code>/GroupA/GroupB/Dataset1</code>, 
  the link <code>GroupB</code> is a member of the group that is the target 
  of the link <code>GroupA</code>.</p>

  <p>The first component in a link path may be any of the 
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The special character dot (., a period), the current group</li>
    <li>The special character slash (/), the root group</li>
    <li>The name of a link that is a member of the current group</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Link names may be any string of ASCII or UTF-8 characters that do 
  not contain a slash or a single dot. These are reserved as noted above. 
  However, users are advised to avoid the use of punctuation and 
  non-printing characters in link names: these may create problems for 
  other software. </p>

  <p>In an <em><b>absolute link path</b></em> for an object, we start with 
  a slash as the root group, and then we add other link names 
  separated by slashes to get to the object. An example might be 
  <code>/GroupA/GroupB/Dataset1</code>. What we are really saying 
  when we write <code>/GroupA/GroupB/Dataset1</code> is the following: 
  to get to the dataset that is the target of the <code>Dataset1</code> link, 
  start at the root group, look for the link called <code>GroupA</code>, and 
  follow it. The <code>GroupA</code> link is a member of the root group. 
  Next, look for the link called <code>GroupB</code>, and follow it. 
  <code>GroupB</code> is a member of the group that is the target of 
  the link called <code>GroupA</code>. Finally, find the link called 
  <code>Dataset1</code> in the group that is the target of the link called 
  <code>GroupB</code>, and follow it. </p>
  
  <p>A <em><b>relative link path</b></em> starts from some group other 
  than the root group. In the figure below is a group that is the target 
  of the link <code>YB</code>. If this group has been opened, it could be 
  used as the starting point for a relative link path to the dataset that 
  is the target of the <code>Y3</code> link.  The relative link path 
  would be <code>YC/Y3</code>.</p>

  <p>There may be multiple link paths to an object. In the figure below, 
  the dataset that is the target of the absolute link path 
  <code>/YA/Y1</code> is the same dataset that is the target of the 
  absolute link path <code>/YA/YB/YC/Y3</code>. </p>
  
  <p>The dataset that is the target of the <code>Y1</code> and 
  <code>Y3</code> links might be accessed using different relative link 
  paths from the <code>YB</code> group (the group that is the target of 
  the <code>YB</code> link). Possible relative link paths are 
  <code>YC/Y3</code> and <code>YC/YD/Y1</code>.</p>

<br />

  <p>Note that relative link paths in HDF5 do not employ the 
  <code>../ </code> notation. The <code>../ </code> notation is used
  in UNIX to indicate a parent directory and is not used in HDF5 to indicate
  a parent group.</p>

  <p>Another feature to note in the figure above is what the link 
  <code>YD</code> represents. Since the underlying structure of an HDF5 
  file is a directed graph, circular references such as <code>YD</code> 
  are possible. If the structure of an HDF5 file kept to a strict tree 
  structure like that used in file systems, then circular references 
  would not be possible. In the figure above, the dataset specified 
  by the <code>/YA/Y1</code> link path could also be specified with 
  the following link path: <code>/YA/YB/YC/YD/Y1</code>. Another 
  example is the ZBB link in the <a href="#ExamplesOfGroupsAndLinks">
  &ldquo;Examples of Groups and Links&rdquo;</a> section below. </p>

        <p><a name="IdentifiersAndLinkPaths"><b>Identifiers and link 
        paths</b></a></p>
        
        <p>Identifiers are generated and returned to an application when 
        a group or file is created or opened. Identifiers are then used 
        in the <code>loc_id</code> parameter along with link paths in the 
        <code>name</code> parameter of function calls to create or open 
        other groups and links. Link paths can be either absolute or 
        relative. Possible identifiers and the appropriate link path type 
        for each kind of identifier are described below.  </p>
        
        <p><b>File identifier and absolute link path.</b> When a file is 
        created or opened by an application, a file identifier is returned. 
        When the file identifier is used in a function call, the name 
        parameter should specify an absolute link path. With the file 
        identifier and an absolute link path, the function call will be 
        able to identify the file to work on and the location of the object 
        from the root group. To operate on the root group, use a file 
        identifier and a slash, <code>/</code>. If a relative link path 
        is used with a file identifier, then the relative link path uses 
        the root group as its starting point.</p>
        
        <p><b>Group identifer and relative link path.</b> When a group is 
        created or opened, a group identifier is returned. When the group 
        identifier is used in a function call, the <code>name</code> 
        parameter can specify either a relative link path or an absolute 
        link path. With the group identifier and a relative link path, 
        the function call will be able to identify the group and the 
        location of the object from the group. With the group identifier 
        and an absolute link path, the function call will be able to 
        identify the file to work on and the location of the object 
        from the root group.</p>
        
        <p><b>Any identifier and absolute link path.</b> With any 
        identifier and an absolute link path, a function call can create 
        or open a group or link that is not connected to the identifier. 
        The function call uses the identifier to specify the file to 
        work in and uses the absolute link path to specify the link to 
        the created or opened group or dataset from the root group.</p>

<!-- 2.4.2011. MEE. The statements above about identifiers and absolute 
and relative link paths seem today to work with groups and links. There 
are other resources such as attributes, datatypes, and datasets that 
probably would work with these rules, but how identifiers and link path
types work with these should be described in their chapters or in the 
Objects and Identifiers chapter.

<a name="HardAndSymbolicLinks">
<h4>4.2.4. Hard and Symbolic Links</h4>
</a>
  <p>Two types of links have been defined in HDF5: hard and symbolic. Hard 
  links refer to an object with a physical address, and symbolic links refer 
  to an object with link paths and names. Characteristics of hard and symbolic 
  links are listed below.</p>
  
  <p>Characteristics of a hard link:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A hard link is made with a physical address in the file</li>
    <li>A hard link occurs within a single file</li>
    <li>When a group or dataset is created, a hard link is also
        created </li>
    <li>At least one hard link exists for every group or dataset </li>
    <li>A hard link and the group or dataset that is the target of the link 
        exist together (hard links cannot dangle) </li>
    <li>A hard link is created using <code>H5Lcreate_hard</code></li>
    <li>A group or dataset may be the target of more than one hard link </li>
    <li>If a group or dataset is not the target of at least one hard link, 
        then the group or dataset cannot be accessed, and the space occupied 
        by the group or dataset will be reclaimed the next time the 
        <code>h5repack</code> tool is run</li>
    <li>The target of a hard link will increase its reference count by one 
        when the hard link is created, and the reference count will decline 
        by one when the hard link is deleted</li>
</ul>

  <p>Characteristics of a symbolic link:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A symbolic link uses a name rather than a physical address</li>
    <li>The target of a symbolic link can be changed</li>
    <li>There are two types of symbolic links: soft and external</li>
    <li>The target of a soft symbolic link (a soft link) will be a group 
        or dataset within a file</li>
    <li>The target of an external symbolic link (an external link) will be 
        a group or dataset in another file</li>
    <li>A symbolic link can exist with or without its target object

        <p>The library maintains for each object a count of the number 
        of hard links that have the object as their target. This is the 
        object&rsquo;s <em><b>reference count</b></em>. When the object 
        is created, a hard link is also created, and the reference count 
        for the object is set to one. The reference count for an object 
        is incremented or decremented each time a hard link with the object 
        as the target is created or deleted. If an object becomes the 
        target of a symbolic link, the reference count will not be 
        changed. </p>
        
        <p>If the reference count for an object goes to zero, the library 
        removes the object. Removing the object does not mean that the file 
        size shrinks by the size occupied by the object. The space that the 
        object used might at some point be used by other function calls. 
        Using the <code>h5repack</code> tool will reclaim the unused space 
        and decrease the file size. </p>
        
        <p>The reference count can be altered programmatically with the 
        <code>H5Oincr_refcount</code> and <code>H5Odec_refcount</code> 
        functions. For more information, see the

  The following is an email from Barbara from 8.15.2013:
  
Hi Mark,

I looked at the tests and found an example that just passes in "." for the name of the existing group.

That worked with H5Gcreate_anon! :)

So you *can* use H5Lcreate_hard to make the anonymous group permanent:

    gid = H5Gcreate_anon(file_id, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
    status = H5Lcreate_hard (gid, ".", file_id, "GroupH5Lcreate_hard",
         H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);

You can also use H5Olink to do this:

    gid = H5Gcreate_anon(file_id, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
    status = H5Olink (gid, file_id, "GroupH5Olink", H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT)

I don't see anywhere in H5Lcreate_hard that it says you can pass in ".", though.

-Barbara
  
See HDFFV-8499. FB found that nly H5Olink should be used to create a 
link to anonymous groups, datasets, and committed datatypes. He talked 
with Larry, and Larry looked at the test.

<h4>4.2.7. Examples of Groups and Links</h4>
</a>
  <p>The figures below illustrate the range of possibilities for groups 
  and links. In the figures, circles are used to represent groups, 
  rectangles are used for datasets, solid arrows are used for hard links, 
  and dashed arrows are used for symbolic links.</p>

  way a file system operates.</p>

  <p>When a new object is created, the HDF5 Library executes the 
  link operation in the background immediately after creating the object. 
  In other words, the creation operation creates the object and creates
  the hard link that connects the object to a group.</p>
    
  <a name="ProgModelCreateGroup"> 
<h4>4.3.1. Creating a Group</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>To create a group, use the <code>H5Gcreate</code> function. 
  When used, <code>H5Gcreate</code> creates a group, opens the group 
  (returns an identifier that can be used in other operations), and 
  creates a hard link. </p>
  
  <p>To create a group, specify values for the <code>loc_id</code> 
  and <code>name</code> parameters and use the default property list 
  parameter value (<code>H5P_DEFAULT</code>) for the property list 
  parameters. The <code>loc_id</code> parameter is used to specify the 
  location identifier. The location identifier is the object 
  identifier for the file or group where the new group will be connected. 
  The value of the <code>name</code> parameter will be a link or link path. 
  If the value of <code>loc_id</code> is a file identifier, then the 
  value of the <code>name</code> parameter will be an absolute link path. 
  If the value of <code>loc_id</code> is a group identifier, then the 
  value of the <code>name</code> parameter should be a relative link path 
  from the group specified with the <code>loc_id</code> parameter. If 
  <code>loc_id</code> is a group identifier, then the <code>name</code> 
  parameter could be an absolute link path. See 
  <a href="#LinkPaths">&ldquo;Link Paths&rdquo;</a> and 
  <a href="#IdentifiersAndLinkPaths">&ldquo;Identifiers and Link 
  Paths&rdquo;</a> for more information.  </p>
  
  <p>The code in the example below creates three groups. </p>
  
  <p>The first group that is created is the target of the 
  <code>Data</code> link. The <code>Data</code> link 
  is a member of the root group, and the location identifier 
  <code>file_id</code> is the object identifier for the file. The 
  identifier for the file was returned to the application as a result of 
  the file being opened in the second line of the example.</p>
  
  <p>Two other groups are then created and linked to the group that is 
  the target of the <code>Data</code> link. The first group uses the 
  file identifier <code>file_id</code> and an absolute link path 
  for the name of the link. The second group uses the group 
  identifier <code>group_id</code> and a relative link path for the name 
  of the link. The identifier <code>group_id</code> was returned when 
  the group that is the target of the <code>Data</code> link was 
  created.</p>

<h4>4.3.2. Opening a Group</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>It is often useful to explicitly open a group when working with 
  objects that are the targets of links that are members of that group. 
  To open a group, use the <code>H5Gopen</code> function. </p>
  
  <p>The example below refers to the groups in Figure 5 above and 
  illustrates different ways to open groups. Opening a dataset is a similar 
  process. </p>
  
  <p>To open an object using a relative link path, an application 
  must first open the group or file on which the relative link path is 
  based. In the first line of the example below, a previously-acquired 
  file identifier, <code>file_id</code>, is used to open the group 
  that is the target of the <code>/Data</code> link path, and then 
  the returned group identifier, <code>group_id</code>, and a relative 
  link path, <code>Data_new1</code>, are used to open the group that is the 
  target of the <code>Data_new1</code> link.</p>
  
  <p>To open an object using an absolute link path, the application 
  can use the file identifier, <code>file_id</code>, and an absolute link 
  path. In the third line of the example below, <code>file_id</code> is used 
  with <code>/Data/Data_new2</code> to open the group that is the target of 
  the <code>Data_new2</code> link.</p>

  <a name="CreatingADataset">
<h4>4.3.3. Creating a Dataset</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>The process of creating a dataset is like the process of creating 
  a group that was discussed above. When a dataset is created, a hard 
  link to it is automatically created. The link will be a member of a 
  group, and when we talk about the dataset, we will use the name of 
  the link to refer to the dataset. As with groups, a dataset may be 
  created in a group by specifying an absolute link path or a relative 
  link path. The example below illustrates both approaches to creating 
  a dataset in the group that is the target of the <code>/Data</code> 
  link. The absolute link path to the first dataset is 
  <code>/Data/CData</code>. The <code>H5Dcreate</code> function uses a 
  previously-acquired <code>file_id</code> and the default property list 
  parameter <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code>. For the second dataset, the example 
  first opens the group which will be the source of the link to the 
  dataset, and then uses the <code>group_id</code> and the relative link 
  <code>Cdata2</code> to create and locate the dataset.</p>

<h4>4.3.4. Closing a Group</h4>

  <p>To ensure the integrity of HDF5 objects and to release system 
  resources, an application should always call the appropriate 
  close function when it is through working with an HDF5 object. 
  In the case of groups, <code>H5Gclose</code> ends access to the group 
  and releases any resources the HDF5 Library has maintained 
  in support of that access including the group identifier.  </p>
  
  <p>As illustrated in the example below, all that is required for an 
  <code>H5Gclose</code> call is the group identifier acquired when 
  the group was opened. There are no relative versus absolute link path 
  considerations.</p>

<h4>4.3.5. Creating Hard Links </h4>
  </a>

  <p>When a group or a dataset is created, a hard link is also created. 
  This hard link gives the group or dataset a location in the group 
  hierarchy. After a group or dataset is created, additional hard links 
  can be explicitly added by means of the <code>H5Lcreate_hard</code> 
  function call to improve access and resource efficiency. See the 
  <a href="#DefiningGroupsAndLinks"> &ldquo;Defining Groups and 
  Links&rdquo;</a> section for more information.</p>

  <p>The code in the example below illustrates the creation of a hard link 
  named <code>Y3</code>. 
  Once that link is created, the dataset that is the target of the 
  absolute link path <code>/YA/Y1</code> can also be accessed by means 
  of the absolute link path <code>/YA/YB/YC/Y3</code>. </p>
  
  <p>Here are some comments for each line in the example below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The file is opened. The identifier <code>file_id</code> is 
      returned.</li>
    <li>The group that is the target of the <code>/YA/YB/YC</code> link
      is opened and returns the <code>group_id</code> identifier.</li>
    <li>The <code>Y3</code> link is created. The <code>file_id</code> 
      identifier and the absolute link path <code>/YA/Y1</code> are 
      used to specify the dataset that will be the target of the new 
      link. The <code>group_id</code> identifier specifies the group 
      that is the target of the <code>/YA/YB/YC</code> link is the 
      source of the new link. The new link is named <code>Y3</code>. 
      The default property list value (<code>H5P_DEFAULT</code>) is 
      used for the property list parameters.</li>
    <li>This line shows an alternate way to create <code>Y3</code>. The 
      difference between this line and the one above it is the 
      <code>file_id</code> is used with an absolute link path to 
      define the new link. </li>

  <a name="ProgModelCreatingSymbolicLinks">
<h4>4.3.6. Creating Symbolic Links</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>Symbolic links are based on names and not on physical file addresses. 
  Symbolic links are similar to the soft links, aliases, and shortcuts 
  that are used with various operating systems. Programmers can use 
  symbolic links to more easily work with any long link paths they may 
  be using and to work with objects in other HDF5 files. There are two
  kinds of symbolic links: soft and external. Soft links are 
  used within a single file. External links are used between files.</p>
  
  <p>A big difference between symbolic links and hard links is the status 
  of the target when the link is created. The target of a hard link must 
  exist when the hard link is created. The target of a symbolic link may 
  or may not exist when the link is created. If a symbolic link is created 
  and the target does not exist, the link is said to dangle or to be a 
  dangling link. So, symbolic links are more flexible than hard links.</p>

  <p><b>To create a soft link</b>, use the 
  <a href="../RM/RM_H5L.html#Link-CreateSoft">
  <code>H5Lcreate_soft</code></a> function call. The function call has five 
  parameters. The last two are property lists. In the example below, the 
  default property list value <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code> is used. The first 
  three parameters are called in the <cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite> 
  <code>target_path</code>, <code>link_loc_id</code>, and 
  <code>link_name</code>. </p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>target_path</code> is a link path to the target of 
  the soft link. This is not the soft link. This is what the soft link 
  resolves to when the soft link is used. The links in this link path 
  may or may not exist when the soft link is created, but the links and 
  any intermediate groups in this link path must exist when the soft link 
  is used in order for the soft link to work. </p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>link_loc_id</code> is a file identifier or a 
  group identifier. If the value of this parameter is a file identifier, 
  then the values of the <code>target_path</code> and 
  <code>link_name</code> parameters should be absolute link paths. If 
  the value of this parameter is a group identifier, then the values of 
  the <code>target_path</code> and <code>link_name</code> parameters 
  could be either relative or absolute link paths. A relative link 
  path would start from the group identifier's group. </p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>link_name</code> is the name of the new soft 
  link.</p>
  
  <p>The example below creates a soft link called <code>2010</code> 
  with a <code>link_loc_id</code> of <code>file_id</code> and a 
  <code>target_path</code> of <code>/YA/YB/YC/Y3</code>. The example 
  then opens the dataset that is the target of the soft link.</p>

  <p><b>To create an external link</b>, use the 
  <a href="../RM/RM_H5L.html#Link-CreateExternal">
  <code>H5Lcreate_external</code></a> function call. The parameters used 
  with <code>H5Lcreate_external</code> are similar to those used with 
  <code>H5Lcreate_soft</code>. The difference is that an HDF5 file is 
  specified with <code>H5Lcreate_external</code>.</p>
  
  The <code>H5Lcreate_external</code> function has six parameters. The 
  last two are property lists. In the example below, the default property 
  list value <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code> is used. The first four parameters 
  are <code>target_file_name</code>, <code>target_obj_name</code>, 
  <code>link_loc_id</code>, and <code>link_name</code>. </p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>target_file_name</code> is the name of the file 
  that holds the object that is the target of the external link. Enough 
  path information should be specified so that the file can be found. In 
  the example below, the value of <code>target_file_name</code> is 
  <code>FileN.h5</code>, and the path to the file is 
  <code>/file_server/data_storage</code>.</p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>target_obj_name</code> is a link path to the object 
  that is the target of the external link. The link path is an absolute 
  link path in the file specified by the <code>target_file_name</code> 
  parameter. This is not the external link. This is what the external link 
  resolves to when the external link is used. The links in this link path 
  may or may not exist when the external link is created, but the links and 
  any intermediate groups in this link path must exist when the external link 
  is used in order for the external link to work. In the example below, 
  the value of the <code>target_obj_name</code> parameter is 
  <code>/NA/N1</code>.</p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>link_loc_id</code> is a file identifier or a 
  group identifier. If the value of this parameter is a file identifier, 
  then the value of the <code>link_name</code> parameter should be an 
  absolute link path. If the value of this parameter is a group identifier, 
  then the value of the <code>link_name</code> parameter could be either 
  relative or absolute link paths. A relative link path would start from 
  the group identifier's group. In the example below, the value of 
  <code>link_loc_id</code> is <code>file_id</code>.</p>

  <p>The value of <code>link_name</code> is the name of the new external 
  link. The value of this parameter might be either a relative or an 
  absolute link path as described in the paragraph above. In the 
  example below, the value of <code>link_name</code> is the 
  absolute link path <code>/MC</code>.</p>

        hold an object&rsquo;s address. Symbolic links store the link 
        path of an object and do not effect the reference count for an 
        object. User-defined links blur this neat division of links 
        into hard and symbolic types. A user-defined link might be 
        built so that it changes the reference count like a hard link 
        and so that it can dangle like a symbolic link.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to hard and symbolic links, it might be also be 
        useful to think about links as being strong or weak. A strong 
        link effects the reference count of an object. Deleting the last 
        strong link would make the object inaccessible. A hard link would 
        be a strong link as would any user-defined link that effected 
        the reference count. A weak link does not effect the reference 
        count of an object. A weak link would be more flexible and 
        ambiguous like symbolic links. </p>

        not prevent you from deleting the last link to an object. To see 
        if an object has only one link, use the <code>H5Oget_info</code>

  <a name="MovingOrRenamingAnObject">
<h4>4.3.8. Moving or Renaming an Object</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>When we talk about renaming or moving an object, we do not actually 
  rename or move the object. An object does not have a name: the name 
  comes from a link. An object cannot be moved. When the object is created, 
  it is put in a permanent location in the file. What changes is the 
  link path to the object. </p>
  
  <p>One way to rename or move an object is to use the 
  <code>H5Lmove</code> function call. This function call will delete the 
  existing link and create a new link in one operation. </p>
  
  <p>Another way to rename or move an object is to use the 
  <code>H5Ldelete</code> function call and one of the 
  <code>H5Lcreate_*</code> function calls. These function calls will delete 
  the existing link and create a new link. </p>

  <p>Exercise caution in the use of <code>H5Lmove</code> and 
  <code>H5Ldelete</code> as these functions each include a step that 
  deletes a link to an object. If the link that is removed is the only 
  hard link to the object, that object will become permanently inaccessible 
  in the file. </p>

  <p>Scenario 1: Removing the last link</p>
  <p>To avoid removing the last link to an object or otherwise making an 
  object inaccessible, use the <code>H5Oget_info</code> 
  function. Confirm that the value of the reference count field (rc) is 
  greater than 1. </p>

  <p>Scenario 2: Moving a link that isolates an object</p>
  <p>Consider the following example. Assume that the group that is the 
  target of the <code>group2</code> link can only be accessed via the 
  following absolute link path: <code>/top_group/group1/group2/</code>.</p>

  <p>Suppose <code>H5Lmove</code> is used to move <code>top_group</code> 
  to the group that is the target of the <code>group2</code> link. 
  Since <code>top_group</code> was the only route from the root group to 
  <code>group1</code> (the group that is the target of the 
  <code>group1</code> link), there is no longer a path by which we can access 
  <code>group1</code>, <code>group2</code>, or any member datasets. 
  And since <code>top_group</code> is now a member of <code>group2</code>,
  <code>top_group</code> itself and any member datasets have thereby also 
  become inaccessible.</p>

<h4 class=pagebefore>4.3.9. Discovering Groups and Links</h4>
  </a>

  <p>The structure of an HDF5 file is 
  <span class="termDefinition">self-describing</span>. This means that 
  an application can navigate an HDF5 file to discover and understand 
  some or all of the groups and links in the file. The <code>H5Ovisit</code>, 
  <code>H5Lexists</code>, <code>H5Literate</code>, and <code>H5Lvisit</code>
  function calls can be used in the discovery process.</p>
  
  <p>The <code>H5Ovisit</code> function enables applications to 
  retrieve information about the objects in a group and any sub-groups 
  of that group. This function returns the same information about each 
  object that is returned with the <code>H5Oget_info</code> function. 
  The information that is returned for each object by <code>H5Ovisit</code> 
  includes the following: address, type, reference count, when last 
  changed, when last accessed, when created, number of attributes, 
  size, object header size used and free, and other attribute settings.
  For more information, see the <a href="#DiscoverInfo">&ldquo;Discovering 
  Information about Groups and Links&rdquo;</a> section below. </p>

  <p>The <code>H5Lexists</code> function enables applications to determine 
  whether a link with the specified name exists in a group. Only the 
  presence of the link is checked. The type of link is not checked. This 
  function call only checks the final link in a link path. To be certain 
  that the final link in a link path exists, each link in the link path 
  should be checked.</p>

  <p>The <code>H5Literate</code> function enables applications to iterate 
  through links in a group. This function does not iterate through the 
  links in any groups that are targets of links in this group. Suppose 
  there is a group that is the target of the link called 2010. Suppose 
  also that this group contains links to three datasets and two groups. 
  Using <code>H5Literate</code> would tell us that there are five 
  links, but it would not tell us anything about the links contained 
  in the two groups. </p>
      
  <p>The <code>H5Lvisit</code> function enables applications to iterate 
  through links in a group and through the links in any sub-groups. This 
  function does iterate through the links in any groups that are targets 
  of links in this group unlike <code>H5Literate</code>. Suppose there is 
  a group that is the target of the link called <code>2010</code>. Suppose 
  also that this group contains links to three datasets and two groups. 
  Using <code>H5Lvisit</code> would tell us that there are five links. 
  <code>H5Lvisit</code> will also investigate the two groups and tell us 
  about the links contained in the two groups. If those two groups have 
  sub-groups, then <code>H5Lvisit</code> will investigate all of the 
  sub-groups. <code>H5Lvisit</code> and <code>H5Literate</code> both 
  return the same information about each link they encounter. That 
  information includes the type of link, the creation order if valid, and 
  the character set used with the link name. The information also includes 
  one of the following: the address the link points to if the link 
  is a hard link, or the size of the link if the link is a symbolic link. </p>

  <p>The following examples illustrate how to use functions. These

  <p>In the comments below, assume that <code>FileM.h5</code> and 
  <code>FileN.h5</code> have been opened. Assume also that the file 
  identifier variable <code>file_id_M</code> has been 
  returned for <code>FileM.h5</code> and the file identifier variable 
  <code>file_id_N</code> has been returned for <code>FileN.h5</code>.</p>
  
  <p>If we want information about the group that is the target of the link 
  <code>NA</code>, then we might use the following:</p>
  

<table width="600" cellspacing="0" align="center">
    <tr valign="top"> 
        <td align="left">
        <hr color="green" size="3"/>
<pre>
  status = H5Gopen(file_id_N, "/NA", H5P_DEFAULT)
  status = H5Ovisit(group_id, H5_INDEX_NAME, H5_ITER_NATIVE, object_info, *op_data)</pre>
        </td></tr>
    <tr><td><hr color="green" size="1" /></td></tr>
    <tr valign="top">

        <b>Example 9. Using <code>H5Ovisit</code></b> 
        <hr color="green" size="3"/></td>
        </tr>
</table>
<br />

  <p>Since the file is open, we can use <code>file_id_N</code> to open 
  the group. With <code>group_id</code>, we can investigate the group. In 
  the <code>H5Ovisit</code> function, we use the <code>group_id</code>, 
  <code>H5_INDEX_NAME</code> to specify the type of sorting, 
  <code>H5_ITER_NATIVE</code> to specify that the fastest type of sorting 
  be used, <code>object_info</code> to specify a buffer for the returned 
  information, and <code>*op_data</code> to specify a pointer for the 
  application to use during processing. </p>

  <p>From the function's iterations, we would learn among other things 
  that the group has four links and that the datasets that are the targets 
  of those links each have a reference count of one. </p>
  
  <p>If we want to see if the link <code>MC</code> exists, then we might 
  use the following:</p>
  


<table width="600" cellspacing="0" align="center">
    <tr valign="top"> 
        <td align="left">
        <hr color="green" size="3"/>
<pre>
  status = H5Lexists(file_id_M, "/MC", H5P_DEFAULT)</pre></td>
        </tr>
    <tr><td><hr color="green" size="1" /></td></tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left">
        <b>Example 10. Using <code>H5Lexists</code></b> 
        <hr color="green" size="3"/></td></tr>
</table>
<br />

  <p>If we want to examine the links in <code>FileN.h5</code>, then we 
  might use the following:</p>
  
<table width="600" cellspacing="0" align="center">
    <tr valign="top"> 
        <td align="left">
        <hr color="green" size="3"/>
    <pre>
  status = H5Gopen(file_id_N, "/", H5P_DEFAULT)
  status = H5Literate(group_id, H5_INDEX_NAME, H5_ITER_NATIVE, *idx, 
                      object_info, *op_data)</pre></td>
        </tr>
    <tr><td><hr color="green" size="1" /></td></tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left">
        <b>Example 11. Using <code>H5Literate</code></b> 
        <hr color="green" size="3"/></td></tr>
</table>
<br />


  <p>Since the file is open, we can use <code>file_id_N</code> to open 
  the root group. With <code>group_id</code>, we can investigate the root 
  group. In the <code>H5Literate</code> function, we use the 
  <code>group_id</code>, <code>H5_INDEX_NAME</code> to specify the type of 
  sorting, <code>H5_ITER_NATIVE</code> to specify that the fastest type of 
  sorting be used, <code>*idx</code> to specify a pointer to be used if 
  the iteration process is interrupted, <code>object_info</code> to 
  specify a buffer for the returned information, and <code>*op_data</code> 
  to specify a pointer for the application to use during processing. </p>

  <p>From this function, we would learn among other things 
  that the root group has one hard link. We would not learn anything about 
  the links contained in the group that is the target of the 
  <code>/NA</code> link. To learn about all the links in 
  <code>FileN.h5</code> we might use the following:</p>

<br />

  <p>Since the file is open, we can use <code>file_id_N</code> to open 
  the root group. With <code>group_id</code>, we can investigate the root 
  group. In the <code>H5Lvisit</code> function, we use the 
  <code>group_id</code>, <code>H5_INDEX_NAME</code> to specify the type of

  <p>The <code>h5dump</code> application program is a command-line 
  utility that is distributed with HDF5. It can be used to inspect 
  the contents of an HDF5 file. It can show the structure of a file 
  so that you can determine where to create an object or so that you 
  can verify that your application program actually created an object.</p>
  
  <p>In the case of the new group created in the 
  &ldquo;<a href="#ProgModelCreateGroup">Creating a group</a>&rdquo; section, 
  the following <code>h5dump</code> command will display the 
  contents of <code>FileZ.h5</code>:</p>

<dir><pre>
h5dump FileZ.h5 
</pre></dir>

  <p>
  Assuming that <code>Data</code>, <code>Data_new1</code>,  and 
  <code>Data_new2</code> are the only objects that exist in 
  <code>FileZ.h5</code>, the output will look something like the 
  following:</p>

<dir><pre>
HDF5 "FileZ.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
GROUP Data {
GROUP Data_new1 {
GROUP Data_new2 {
}
}
}

  <p>This section presents several samples of possible HDF5 group 
  structures.</p>
  
  <p>The figure below shows examples of the structure of a file with three 
  groups and one dataset. The file in a) contains three groups: 
  the root group and two member groups. In b), a dataset has been 
  created and linked to <code>/group1</code> with the link named 
  <code>dset1</code>. In c), a link named <code>dset2</code> from 
  <code>/group2</code> to the dataset has been added. Note that there is 
  only one copy of the dataset; there are two links to it, and it can be 
  accessed either as <code>/group1/dset1</code> or as 
  <code>/group2/dset2</code>. The file in d) illustrates that one of the 
  two links to the dataset can be deleted. In this case, the link from 
  <code>/group1</code> has been removed.  The dataset itself has not 
  been deleted; it is still in the file, but it can only be accessed as 
  <code>/group1/dset2</code>.</p>

<!-- NEW PAGE -->
  <p>The figure below illustrates loops in an HDF5 group structure. 
  The file in a) contains three groups and a dataset. 
  The group that is the target of the <code>group2</code> link is a 
  member of the root group and is also a member of the group that is the 
  target of the <code>group1</code> link. The group that is the target 
  of the <code>group2</code> link can be accessed by either of two link 
  paths: <code>/group2</code> or <code>/group1/GXX</code>. 
  Similarly, the dataset can be accessed by these link paths: 
  <code>/group2/dset1</code> or <code>/group1/GXX/dset1</code>.</p>

  <p>A different case is illustrated in b): the dataset is the target 
  of two links that are both members of the same group. In this case, 
  the dataset again has two names: <code>/group1/dset1</code> and 
  <code>/group1/dset2</code>.</p>
  
  <p>In c), the dataset that is the target of the <code>dset1</code> 
  link is a member of two groups. The dataset has three absolute link 
  paths: <code>/group1/dset1</code>, <code>/group2/dset2</code>, and 
  <code>/group1/GXX/dset2</code>. </p>
  
  <p>In d), two of the groups are members of each other, and the 
  dataset is a member of both groups. In this case, there are an infinite 
  number of paths to the dataset because <code>GXX</code> and 
  <code>GYY</code> can be traversed any number of times on the way from 
  the root group, <code>/</code>, to the dataset. This can yield a link path 
  such as <code>/group1/GXX/GYY/GXX/GYY/GXX/dset2</code>.</p>

  <p>The figure below takes us into the realm of soft links.
  The original file, shown in a) below, contains only three hard links.
  In b), a soft link named <code>dset2</code> has been created.
  The source of the new link is the group that is the target of the 
  <code>group2</code> link. The target of the new link is also the target 
  of the <code>/group1/dset1</code> link path.</p>
  
  <p>In c), another soft link, <code>dset3</code>, has been created 
  in the group that is the target of the <code>group2</code> link. The

  been added in d) along with the hard link <code>dset</code>. The 
  target dataset is now accessible as either <code>/group2/dset</code> or

  <p>External links are like soft links except that the targets of 
  external links are objects in other files. In the figure below, a) 
  shows that FileM.h5 has a dangling external link <code>MC</code>. After 
  FileN.h5 is created, see b), <code>MC</code> can be resolved.</p>

<h4>4.6.1. Link Indexing and Compact Group Storage </h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>In HDF5 Release 1.8.0, a second link indexing and group storage 
  format was added. The new format enables more efficient compact storage 
  for very small groups, improved link indexing for large groups, 
  and other advanced features. The original link indexing format - links 
  are stored in the group&rsquo;s local heap and are indexed with a B-tree 
  - remains the default. The new implementation is required for external 
  and user-defined links and also enables the use of link names consisting 
  of non-ASCII character sets. For more information, see the 
  <a href="../RM/RM_H5G.html#Group-GroupStyles">
  &ldquo;Group Implementations in HDF5&rdquo;</a> section in the 
  <a href="../RM/RM_H5Front.html" target="RMwindow"><cite>HDF5 
  Reference Manual</cite></a>.</p>
