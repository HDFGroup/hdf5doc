<blockquote>
<strong>A Note to the Reader:</strong>
The primary HDF5 user documents are the online HTML documents
distributed with the HDF5 code and binaries and found on the HDF5 website.
Several users have expressed a desire for documents in an alternative format:
<ul>
<li>Some have requested a version that can be reasonably printed in a 
    single print operation.
<li>Others have requested an easily searchable version.
</ul>
This PDF file has been created expressly to meet these needs.
<p>
The reader will note that each section of this document looks very much
as the corresponding HTML page would look in a web browser.  That is not
accidental as the HTML version remains the HDF5 development team's primary 
documentation vehicle.
