  <p>
  <dt><strong>Motivation:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5fix_swapped_ids</code> 
      corrects a metadata corruption error that manifests as
      incorrect encoding of fractal heap identifiers for attributes 
      and shared object header messages in particular circumstances.  
      This error causes some files created on a big-endian system 
      to be unreadable on a little-endian system. 
      <p>
      <code>H5fix_swapped_ids</code> reverses the incorrect encoding.
      <p>
      This error existed in HDF5 Releases 1.8.0 through
      1.8.4; it was fixed in HDF5 Release 1.8.4-patch1.
      <p>


  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code> corrects metadata encoding errors 
      (the encoding of the fractal heap identifiers for attributes 
      and shared object header messages)
      in certain types of corrupted files.
      <p>
      <strong>To identify the class of potentially-corrupted files:</strong>
      A file might have this problem only when all of the following 
      conditions are met:
      <ul>
        <li>The file was created with a version of the HDF5 library
            from HDF5 Release 1.8.0 (HDF5-1.8.0) 
            through HDF5 Release 1.8.4 (HDF5-1.8.4).
            (The bug was fixed in HDF5 Release 1.8.4-patch1 (HDF5-1.8.4-patch1).)
        <li>The file was created on a big-endian platform (SPARC/Solaris, 
            POWER/AIX, etc.).
        <li>One of the following occurred:
            <ul>
              <li>NetCDF-4 was used to create the file.
              <li>A <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds(fapl, H5F_LIBVER_LATEST, 
                  H5F_LIBVER_LATEST)</code> call was made.
              <li>Shared object header messages were enabled with 
                  <code>H5Pset_shared_mesg_nindexes()</code> 
                  when the file was created.        
            </ul>
        <li>And one of the following occurred:
            <ul>
              <li>More than 8 attributes were added to an object in 
                  the file (in the case of using netCDF-4 or calling 
                  <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code>).
              <li>Messages of the type specified as being shared object
                  header messages were stored in the file (in the case 
                  of calling <code>H5Pset_shared_mesg_nindexes</code>).
            </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If all of the above conditions are satisfied, a file may have 
      this error.
      A file created without meeting all of the above conditions will 
      <i>not</i> be corrupted.
      
      <p>
      <strong>To determine whether a specific file is corrupted:</strong>
      Once you have determined that a file is a member of
      the class that might be corrupted, assess the file as follows.
      <p>
      While there is no foolproof way to detect a file with these 
      incorrectly encoded identifiers, if <code>h5dump</code> reports 
      an error message similar to the foll owing when displaying 
      information about the file, it's likely that you have a file 
      with this problem:
      <pre>
        h5dump error: error getting attribute information.  
      </pre>

      <p>
      For files created with netCDF-4, this message will generally 
      display when dumping information about the root group.  
      If your application is generating an error stack similar to this, 
      it's also likely that the file has this problem:
      <pre>
        .
        .
        .

      <p>
      <strong>To correct the error:</strong>
      This error can be corrected with <code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code>
      on either a big- or little-endian machine.
      <p>
      The following invocation of <code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code>
      reads the corrupted file <em>old_file</em> and
      writes <em>new_file</em> with the corrected identifiers.
      <pre>
        <code>h5fix_swapped_ids <em>old_file</em> <em>new_file</em></code> 
      </pre>

      <p>
      <strong>To acquire <code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code>:</strong>
      The tool is available in both binary and source forms at 
      <a href="URL">URL</a>.
       
      <p>
      <strong>Note/Warning:</strong> 
      As stated above, there is no definitive way to determine whether 
      a specific file is corrupted.  You can only determine 
      (a) whether a file is in a class of files that is subject to 
          this corruption and
      (b) whether it is probably corrupted.
      It is therefore critical to verify that <em>new_file</em>
      is indeed fixed before discarding <em>old_file</em>.


  <p>
  <dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd><dl>
      <dt><code><em>old_file</em></code>
          <dd>The corrupted file, as input.
      <dt><code><em>new_file</em></code>
          <dd>The corrected file, as output.
      </dl>


  <p>
  <dt><strong>Example Usage:</strong>
    <dd>The following usage generates a corrected file, <em>new_file</em>,
      from <em>old_file</em>, a file containing encoding errors in 
      fractal heap identifiers for attributes and shared object header 
      messages, as described above:
      <pre>
      <code>h5fix_swapped_ids <em>old_file</em> <em>new_file</em></code> 
      </pre>
