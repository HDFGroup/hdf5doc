  <dt><strong>Tool Name:</strong> <a name="Tools-FixSwappedIds">h5fix_swapped_ids</a>

  <dt><strong>Syntax:</strong>
    <dd><code>h5fix_swapped_ids 
            <em>old_file</em>
            <em>new_file</em>
            </code>

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
      <dd>Fixes files with fractal heap identifier encoding errors.

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Motivation:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5fix_swapped_ids</code> 
      corrects a metadata corruption error that manifests as
      incorrect encoding of fractal heap identifiers for attributes 
      and shared object header messages.  
      This error occurs only in particular circumstances and
      causes some files created on a big-endian system 
      to be unreadable on a little-endian system. 
      <p>
      <code>H5fix_swapped_ids</code> corrects the incorrect encoding.
      <p>
      This error existed in HDF5 Releases 1.8.0 through
      1.8.4; it was fixed in HDF5 Release 1.8.4-patch1.
      <p>

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code> corrects metadata encoding errors 
      (the encoding of the fractal heap identifiers for attributes 
      and shared object header messages)
      in certain types of corrupted files.
      <p>
      <strong>To identify the class of potentially-corrupted files:</strong>
      A file might have this problem only when all of the following 
      conditions are met:
      <ul>
        <li>The file was created with a version of the HDF5 library
            from HDF5 Release 1.8.0 (HDF5-1.8.0) 
            through HDF5 Release 1.8.4 (HDF5-1.8.4).
            <br>
            (The bug was fixed in HDF5 Release 1.8.4-patch1 (HDF5-1.8.4-patch1).)
        <li>The file was created on a big-endian platform (SPARC/Solaris, 
            POWER/AIX, etc.).
        <li>One of the following occurred:
            <ul>
              <li>NetCDF-4 was used to create the file and
                  more than 8 attributes were added to an object in the file.
              <li>An <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds(fapl, H5F_LIBVER_LATEST, 
                  H5F_LIBVER_LATEST)</code> call was made and
                  more than 8 attributes were added to an object in the file.
              <li>Shared object header messages were enabled with 
                  <code>H5Pset_shared_mesg_nindexes()</code> 
                  when the file was created and
                  messages of the type specified as being shared object
                  header messages were stored in the file.        
            </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
      If all of the above conditions are satisfied, a file may have 
      this error;
      a file that does not meet all of the above conditions will 
      <i>not</i> be corrupted.
      
      <p>
      <strong>To determine whether a specific file is corrupted:</strong>
      While there is no foolproof way to detect a file with these 
      incorrectly encoded identifiers, you can examine a suspect file 
      with <code>h5dump</code>. 
      If <code>h5dump</code> reports an error message similar to the
      following, the file is likely to contain this error:
      <pre>
        h5dump error: error getting attribute information.  
      </pre>

      <p>
      For files created with netCDF-4, this message will generally 
      display when dumping information about the root group.  
      If your application is generating an error stack similar to this, 
      it's also likely that the file has this problem:
      <pre>
        .
        .
        .        
        #008: ../../hdf5_v1.8/src/H5B2int.c line 1951 in H5B2_iterate_node():   \
              iterator function failed major: B-Tree node minor: Unable to list \
              node
        #009: ../../hdf5_v1.8/src/H5Adense.c line 1076 in                       \

              Attribute minor: Can't operate on object
        #010: ../../hdf5_v1.8/src/H5HF.c line 680 in H5HF_op(): can't operate   \
              on object from fractal heap major: Heap minor: Can't operate      \
              on object
        #011: ../../hdf5_v1.8/src/H5HFman.c line 462 in H5HF_man_op(): unable   \
              to operate on heap object major: Heap minor: Can't operate on     \
              object
        #012: ../../hdf5_v1.8/src/H5HFman.c line 276 in H5HF_man_op_real():     \

              range
      </pre>

      <p>
      <strong>To correct the error:</strong>
      This error can be corrected with the following 
      <code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code> call:
      <pre>
        <code>h5fix_swapped_ids <em>old_file</em> <em>new_file</em></code> 
      </pre>
      <p>
      <code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code> will 
      read the corrupted file, <em>old_file</em>, and 
      write <em>new_file</em> with the corrected identifiers.
      <p>
      The fix can be performed on either a big-endian or little-endian 
      machine.
      <p>

      <p>
      <strong>To acquire <code>h5fix_swapped_ids</code>:</strong>
      The tool is available in both binary and source forms at 
      <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/special_tools/">
      <code>http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/special_tools/</code></a>.
       
      <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> 
      As stated above, there is no definitive way to determine whether 
      a specific file is corrupted.  You can only determine 
      (a) whether a file is in a class of files that is subject to 
          this corruption and
      (b) whether it is probably corrupted.
      It is therefore critical to verify that <em>new_file</em>
      has indeed been fixed before discarding <em>old_file</em>.

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd><dl>
      <dt><code><em>old_file</em></code>
          <dd>The corrupted file, as input.
      <dt><code><em>new_file</em></code>
          <dd>The corrected file, as output.
      </dl>

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Example Usage:</strong>
    <dd>The following usage generates a corrected file, <em>new_file</em>,
      from <em>old_file</em>, a file containing encoding errors in 
      fractal heap identifiers for attributes and shared object header 
      messages:
      <pre>
      <code>h5fix_swapped_ids <em>old_file</em> <em>new_file</em></code> 
      </pre>
