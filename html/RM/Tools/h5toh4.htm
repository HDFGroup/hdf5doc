    <dd>The <code>h5toh4</code> command-line utility is distributed with the
        <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/h4toh5/">H4toH5 Conversion Library</a>
        and documented in the
        &ldquo;<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/tools/h4toh5/src/unpacked/doc/h4toh5lib_RM.html">H4toH5 
        Conversion Library Reference Manual</a>.&rdquo;

<!-- 
<dt><strong>Syntax:</strong>
    <dd><code>h5toh4 -h</code><br>
        <code>h5toh4 </code><em>
            h5file
            h4file</em><br>
        <code>h5toh4 </code><em>
            h5file</em><br>
        <code>h5toh4 -m </code><em>
            h5file1
            h5file2
            h5file3</em> ...

<p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Converts an HDF5 file into an HDF4 file.

<p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>h5toh4</code> is an HDF5 utility which reads 
        an HDF5 file, <em>h5file</em>, and converts all 
        supported objects and pathways to produce an HDF4 file, 
        <em>h4file</em>.  If <em>h4file</em> already exists, 
        it will be replaced.
        <p>
        If only one file name is given, the name must end in 
        <code>.h5</code> and is assumed to represent the 
        HDF5 input file.  <code>h5toh4</code> replaces the 
        <code>.h5</code> suffix with <code>.hdf</code> to form 
        the name of the resulting HDF4 file and proceeds as above.  
        If a file with the name of the intended HDF4 file already 
        exists, <code>h5toh4</code> exits with an error without 
        changing the contents of any file.
        <p>
        The <code>-m</code> option allows multiple HDF5 file 
        arguments.  Each file name is treated the same as the 
        single file name case above.
        <p>
        The <code>-h</code> option causes the following
        syntax summary to be displayed:
        <pre>              h5toh4 file.h5 file.hdf
              h5toh4 file.h5
              h5toh4 -m file1.h5 file2.h5 ...</pre>
        
        <p>

        The following HDF5 objects occurring in an HDF5 file are 
        converted to HDF4 objects in the HDF4 file:

        <ul>
          <li>HDF5 group objects are converted into HDF4 Vgroup 
              objects.  HDF5 hard links and soft links pointing to 
              objects are converted to HDF4 Vgroup references.
          <li>HDF5 dataset objects of integer datatype are 
              converted into HDF4 SDS objects.  These datasets 
              may have up to 32 fixed dimensions.  
              The slowest varying dimension may be extendable.  
              8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integer datatypes are 
              supported.
          <li>HDF5 dataset objects of floating point datatype 
              are converted into HDF4 SDS objects.  
              These datasets may have up to 32 fixed dimensions.  
              The slowest varying dimension may be extendable.  
              32-bit and 64-bit floating point datatypes are 
              supported.
          <li>HDF5 dataset objects of single dimension and 
              compound datatype are converted into HDF4 Vdata 
              objects. The length of that single dimension may 
              be fixed or extendable.  The members of the 
              compound datatype are constrained to be no more 
              than rank 4.
          <li>HDF5 dataset objects of single dimension and fixed length string
              datatype are converted into HDF4 Vdata objects.  The HDF4 Vdata 
              is a single field whose order is the length of the HDF5 string 
              type.  The number of records of the Vdata is the length of the 
              single dimension which may be fixed or extendable.
        </ul>

        Other objects are not converted and are not recorded
        in the resulting <em>h4file</em>.
        <p>
        Attributes associated with any of the supported HDF5 
        objects are carried over to the HDF4 objects.  
        Attributes may be of integer, floating point, or fixed length 
        string datatype and they may have up to 32 fixed dimensions.
        <p>
        All datatypes are converted to big-endian.  
        Floating point datatypes are converted to IEEE format.

<dt><strong>Note:</strong>
    <dd>The <code>h5toh4</code> and <code>h4toh5</code> utilities 
        are no longer part of the HDF5 product;  
        they are distributed separately through the page
