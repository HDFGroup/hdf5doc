  <dt><strong>Name:</strong><a name="Property-GetMpioActualIoMode">
    H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode</a>

  <dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t </em><code>H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode</code>(
            <em>hid_t </em><code>dxpl_id</code>,
            <em>H5D_mpio_actual_io_mode_t *</em>
	    <code>actual_io_mode</code>)

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    Retrieves the type of I/O that HDF5 actually performed on the
    last parallel I/O call. This is not necessarily the type of I/O requested.

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Motivation:</strong>
    <dd>
      A user can request collective I/O via a data transfer property list
      (DXPL) that has been suitably modified with 
      <code>H5Pset_dxpl_mpio</code>. However,
      HDF5 will sometimes ignore this request and perform independent I/O
      instead. This property allows the user to see what kind of I/O HDF5
      actually performed. Used in conjunction with
      <code>H5Pget_mpio_actual_chunk_opt_mode</code>, this property allows
      the user to determine exactly HDF5 did when attempting collective I/O.

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode</code> 
      retrieves the type of I/O performed on the selection of the current 
      process. This property is set after all I/O is completed; if I/O 
      fails, it will not be set.
      <p>
      Valid values returned in <code>actual_io_mode</code>:

  <p>
    <dt><strong>Note:</strong>
      <dd>
        All processes do not need to have the same value. For example, if I/O 
        is being performed using the multi chunk optimization scheme, one 
        process's selection may include only chunks accessed collectively,  
        while another may include chunks accessed independently. In 
        this case, the first process will report 
        <code>H5D_MPIO_CHUNK_COLLECTIVE</code> while the second will report 
        <code>H5D_MPIO_CHUNK_INDEPENDENT</code>.
