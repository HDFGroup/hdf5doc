  <dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Property-SetMdcConfig">H5Pset_mdc_config</a>
  <dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
      <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Pset_mdc_config</code>(<em>hid_t</em> 
	    <code>plist_id</code>, <em>H5AC_cache_config_t *</em><code>config_ptr</code>)
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
      <dd>Set the initial metadata cache configuration in the indicated File 
	    Access Property List to the supplied value.
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
      <dd>H5Pset_mdc_config attempts to set the initial metadata cache configuration 
	    to the supplied value.  It will fail if an invalid configuration is detected.  
		This configuration is used when the file is opened.
        <p>See the overview of the metadata cache in the special topics section of the 
		user manual for details on what is being configured.  If you haven't read and 
		understood that documentation, you really shouldn't be using this API call.

                In rare circumstances, the raw data throughput requirements

                writes so as to reserve I/O throughput for raw data.  The
                <code>evictions_enabled</code> field exists to allow this.
                However, this is an extreme step, and you have no business
                doing it unless you have read the User Guide section on 
		metadata caching, and have considered all other options 
		carefully.
                <p>
                The <code>evictions_enabled</code> field may not be set to

                <p>
                When this flag is set to <code>FALSE</code>, 
                the metadata cache will not attempt to evict entries 
                to make space for new entries, and thus will grow without
                bound.
                <p>
                Evictions will be re-enabled when this field is set back
