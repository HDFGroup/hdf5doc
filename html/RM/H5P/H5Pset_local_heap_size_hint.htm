  <dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Property-SetLocalHeapSizeHint">H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint</a>
  <dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint</code>(
        <em>hid_t</em> <code>gcpl_id</code>,
        <em>size_t</em> <code>size_hint</code>
    )
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Specifies the anticipated maximum size of a local heap.
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint</code> is used with original-style 
      HDF5 groups (see &ldquo;Motivation&rdquo; below) to specify
      the  anticipated maximum local heap size, <code>size_hint</code>, 
      for groups created with the group creation property list 
      <code>gcpl_id</code>.
      The HDF5 Library then uses <code>size_hint</code>
      to allocate contiguous local heap space in the file for each group
      created with <code>gcpl_id</code>.

      <p>
      For groups with many members or very few members, an appropriate initial 
      value of <code>size_hint</code> would be the anticipated number of group 
      members times the average length of group member names, plus a small margin:
      <pre>
          size_hint = max_number_of_group_members  * 
                      (average_length_of_group_member_link_names + 2)
      </pre>
      <p>
      If it is known that there will be groups with zero members, 
      the use of a group creation property list with <code>size_hint</code> 
      set to to <code>1</code> (one) will guarantee the smallest possible 
      local heap for each of those groups.
      <p>
      Setting <code>size_hint</code> to zero (<code>0</code>) causes the 
      library to make a reasonable estimate for the default local heap size.
      <p>
  <dt><strong>Motivation:</strong>
    <dd>In situations where backward-compatibility is required, specifically, 
      when libraries prior to HDF5 Release 1.8.0 may be used to read the file, 
      groups must be created and maintained in the original style.
      This is HDF5&rsquo;s default behavior.
      If backward compatibility with pre-1.8.0 libraries is not a concern, 
      greater efficiencies can be obtained with the new-format compact and 
      indexed groups.
      See &ldquo;<a href="RM_H5G.html#Group-GroupStyles">Group 
      implementations in HDF5</a>&rdquo; in the H5G API introduction. 
      <p>
      <code>H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint</code> is useful for tuning 
      file size when files contain original-style groups with 
      either zero members or very large numbers of members.
      <p>
      The original style of HDF5 groups, the only style available prior 
      to HDF5 Release 1.8.0, was well-suited for moderate-sized groups
      but was not optimized for either very small or very large groups.
      This original style remains the default, but two new group
      implementations were introduced in HDF5 Release 1.8.0: 
      compact groups to accomodate zero to small numbers of members and 
      indexed groups for thousands or tens of thousands of members 
      ... or millions, if that's what your application requires.
      <p>
      The local heap size hint, <code>size_hint</code>, is a 
      performance tuning parameter <i>for original-style groups</i>.  
      As indicated above, an HDF5 group may have zero, a handful, 
      or tens of thousands of members.  
      Since the original style of HDF5 groups stores the metadata
      for all of these group members in a uniform format in a local heap, 
      the size of that metadata (and hence, the size of the local heap)
      can vary wildly from group to group.
      To intelligently allocate space and to avoid unnecessary fragmentation 
      of the local heap, it can be valuable to provide the library 
      with a hint as to the local heap&rsquo;s likely eventual size.
      This can be particularly valuable when it is known that a group 
      will eventually have a great many members.  
      It can also be useful in conserving space in a file when 
      it is known that certain groups will never have any members.
