  <dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint</code>(
        <em>hid_t</em> <code>gcpl_id</code>,
        <em>size_t</em> <code>size_hint</code>
    )
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Sets the local heap size hint for original-style groups.
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Pset_local_heap_size_hint</code> sets the
      local heap size hint, <code>size_hint</code>, 
      in the group creation property list, <code>gcpl_id</code>,
      for original-style groups. 
      <p>
      The original style of HDF5 groups, the only style available prior 
      to HDF5 Release 1.8.0, was well-suited for moderate-sized groups
      but was not optimized for either very small or very large groups.
      This style remains the default, but
      in HDF5 Release 1.8.0, two new grouping styles were introduced:
      compact groups to accomodate zero to small numbers of members and 
      dense groups for thousands or tens of thousands of members 
      (or millions, if that's what your application requires!).
      <p>
      The local heap size hint, <code>size_hint</code>, is a 
      performance tuning parameter <i>for original-style groups</i>.  
      As indicated above, an HDF5 group may have zero, a handful, 
      or tens of thousands of members.  
      Since the original style of HDF5 groups stored the metadata
      for all of these group members in a uniform format in a local heap, 
      the size of that metadata (and hence, the size of the local heap)
      could vary wildly from group to group.
      To intelligently allocate space and to avoid unnecessary fragmentation 
      of the local heap, it can be valuable to provide the library 
      with a hint as to its likely eventual size.
      This can be particularly valuable when it is known that a group 
      will eventually have a great many members.  
      It can also be useful in conserving space in a file when 
      it is known that certain groups will never have any members.
