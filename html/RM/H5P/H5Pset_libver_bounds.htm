  <dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Property-SetLibverBounds">H5Pset_libver_bounds</a>
  <dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code>(
            <em>hid_t</em> <code>fapl_id</code>,
            <em>H5F_libver_t</em> <code>libver_low</code>,
            <em>H5F_libver_t</em> <code>libver_high</code>
    )
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Sets bounds on library versions, and indirectly format versions, 
        to be used when creating objects.
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code> controls the versions of the object 
        formats that will be used when creating objects in a file.  
        The object format versions are determined indirectly from the 
        HDF5 Library versions specified in the call.
        <p>
        This property is set in the file access property list specified
        by <code>fapl_id</code>. 
        <p>
        When bounds have been set through an <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code>
        call, a function that creates an object will fail if the object 
        cannot be created within the boundaries set in
        <code>libver_low</code> and <code>libver_high</code>.
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd><table>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><em>hid_t</em> <code>fapl_id</code>
        </td>
        <td valign="top">IN: File access property list identifier
        </td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><em>H5F_libver_t</em> <code>libver_low</code>
        </td>
        <td valign="top">IN: The earliest version of the library that 
            will be used for writing objects, indirectly specifying 
            the earliest object format version that can be used when 
            creating objects in the file.
            <p>
            Valid values of <code>libver_low</code> are as follows:
            <table border="0">
              <tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
                  <code>H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST</code> &nbsp; <i>(Default)</i>
              </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
                <code>H5F_LIBVER_18</code>
              </td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
                <code>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</code>
              </td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>
            <p>
            Setting <code>libver_low</code> to <code>H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST</code> 
            will result in objects being created using the 
            <em>earliest possible</em> format for each object. 
            Note that <em>earliest possible</em> is different from 
            <em>earliest</em>, as some features introduced in library versions
            later than 1.0.0 resulted in updates to object formats.  
            With <code>libver_low</code>=<code>H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST</code>, 
            if the application creates an object that requires a feature introduced
            in library versions later than 1.0.0, the earliest possible version
            that supports the requested feature will be used. 
            <p>
            Setting <code>libver_low</code> to <code>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</code> 
            will result in objects being created using the 
            <em>latest available</em> format for each object.   
            This setting means that objects will be created with the latest 
            format versions available (within the range of library versions 
            specified in the call), and can take advantage of the latest 
            features and performance enhancements.
            Objects written with the <code>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</code> setting for 
            <code>libver_low</code> may be accessible to a smaller range of 
            library versions than would be the case if the 
            <code>H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST</code> value had been used.
<!-- NEW PAGE -->
            <p>
            Setting <code>libver_low</code> to the intermediate value
            <code>H5F_LIBVER_18</code> specifies that created or modifed objects 
            must be readable by the HDF5 Release 1.8 series 
            but do not need to be readable by earlier versions.

            </table>
            <p>
            <code>H5F_LIBVER_18</code> specifies that objects may be
            created in a format used by releases up to and including the
            HDF5 Release 1.8 series. 
            Object formats introduced in later releases may not be used.
            <p>
            <code>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</code> specifies that objects may be
            created in the latest format available; there is no requirement
            that earlier versions of the HDF5 library be able to read all
            objects in the file.
