  <dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Property-GetDriverInfo">H5Pget_driver_info</a>
  <dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>void *</em><code>H5Pget_driver_info</code>(
                     <em>hid_t</em> <code>plist_id</code>
    )
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a pointer to file driver information.
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Pget_driver_info</code> returns a pointer to  
        file driver-specific information for the low-level driver 
        associated with the file access or data transfer property list
        <code>plist_id</code>.
        <p>
        The pointer returned by this function points to an 
        &ldquo;uncopied&rdquo; struct.
        Driver-specific versions of that struct are defined for each 
        low-level driver in the relevant source code file 
        <code>H5FD*.c</code>.
        For example, the struct used for the <code>MULTI</code> driver
        is <code>H5FD_multi_fapl_t</code> defined in <code>H5FDmulti.c</code>.
        <p>
        If no driver-specific properties have been registered, 
        <code>H5Pget_driver_info</code> returns <code>NULL</code>. 
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Note:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Pget_driver_info</code> and <code>H5Pset_driver</code> 
        are used only when creating a virtual file driver (VFD) 
        in the virtual file layer (VFL).  For further information, see
        &ldquo;<a href="../TechNotes/VFL.html">Virtual File Layer</a>&rdquo;
        and &ldquo;<a href="../TechNotes/VFLfunc.html">List of VFL 
        Functions</a>&rdquo; in the 
        <a href="../TechNotes.html"><cite>HDF5 Technical Notes</cite></a>.
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><em>hid_t</em> <code>plist_id</code>
            <dd>IN: File access or data transfer property list identifier.
        </dl>
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a pointer to a struct containing 
        low-level driver information. 
        Otherwise returns <code>NULL</code>.
        <p>
        <code>NULL</code> is also returned if no driver-specific properties
        have been registered.  
        No error is pushed on the stack in this case.
