<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Object-Flush">H5Oflush</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t </em><code>H5Oflush</code>(<em>hid_t </em><code>object_id</code>
        )
    <p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
        <dd>Flushes all buffers associated with an HDF5 object to disk.
    <p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
        <dd><code>H5Oflush</code> causes all buffers associated with an
        object to be immediately flushed to disk without removing the
        data from the cache.  
        <p>
        <code>object_id</code> can be any named object associated with an 
        HDF5 file, including a dataset, a group, or a named data type.
        <p>
<dt><strong>Note:</strong>
        <dd>HDF5 does not possess full control over buffering.
        <code>H5Oflush</code> flushes the internal HDF5 buffers then 
        asks the operating system (the OS) to flush the system buffers for the 
        open files.  After that, the OS is responsible for ensuring that
        the data is actually flushed to disk.
    <p>
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top"><em>hid_t </em><code>object_id</code></td>
            <td valign="top">IN: Identifier of the object to be flushed.</td></tr>
    </table></ul>
    <p>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful;
        otherwise returns a negative value.
