<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t </em><code>H5Orefresh</code>(<em>hid_t </em><code>object_id</code>
        )
    <p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
        <dd>Refreshes all buffers associated with an HDF5 object.
    <p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
        <dd><code>H5Orefresh</code> causes all buffers associated with an
        object to be cleared and immediately re-loaded with updated contents from disk.
        <p>
        <dd>This function essentially closes the object, evicts all metadata associated
        with it from the cache, and then re-opens the object. The reopened object is 
        automatically re-registered with the same ID.
    <p>
        <code>object_id</code> can be any named object associated with an 
        HDF5 file, including a dataset, a group, or a named data type.
        <p>
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top"><em>hid_t </em><code>object_id</code></td>
            <td valign="top">IN: Identifier of the object to be refreshed.</td></tr>
    </table></ul>
    <p>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful;
        otherwise returns a negative value.
