<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Identify-RegisterType">H5Iregister_type</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>H5I_type_t</em> <code>H5Iregister_type</code>(
            <em>size_t</em> <code>hash_size</code>, 
            <em>unsigned</em> <code>reserved</code>, 
            <em>H5I_free_t</em> <code>free_func</code>
            )
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Creates and returns a new ID type.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Iregister_type</code> allocates space for a new ID type and 
         returns an identifier for it.

        <p>
        The <code>hash_size</code> parameter indicates the minimum size 
        of the hash table used to store IDs in the new type.

        <p>
        The <code>reserved</code> parameter indicates the number 
        of IDs in this new type to be reserved.  
        Reserved IDs are valid IDs which are not associated with 
        any storage within the library.

        <p>
        The <code>free_func</code> parameter is a function pointer 
        to a function which returns an <em>herr_t</em> and 
        accepts a <em>void *</em>. 
        The purpose of this function is to deallocate memory 
        for a single ID.  
        It will be called by <code>H5Iclear_type</code> 
        and <code>H5Idestroy_type</code> on each ID.  
        This function is NOT called by <code>H5Iremove_verify</code>.  
        The <em>void *</em> will be the same pointer which was passed 
        in to the <code>H5Iregister</code> function.  
        The <code>free_func</code> function should 
        return 0 on success and -1 on failure.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign="top"><em>size_t</em> <code>hash_size</code></td>
            <td valign="top">IN: Size of the hash table (in entries)

	  </tr>
	  <tr>

                for a single ID</td>

    </table></ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
        <dd>Returns the type identifier on success, negative on failure.
<dt><strong>Fortran90 Interface:</strong>
        <dd>This function is not supported in FORTRAN 90.
