<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Identify-DecRef">H5Idec_ref</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>int</em> <code>H5Idec_ref</code>(
            <em>hid_t</em> <code>obj_id</code>
            )
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Decrements the reference count for an object.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Idec_ref</code> decrements the reference count of the object
        identified by <code>obj_id</code>.

        <p>
        The reference count for an object identifier is attached to the 
        information about an object in memory and has no relation to the 
        number of links to an object on disk.

        <p>
        The reference count for a newly created object will be 1.
        Reference counts for objects may be explicitly modified with this
        function or with <code>H5Iinc_ref</code>.
        When an object identifier&rsquo;s reference count reaches zero, 
        the object will be closed.
        Calling an object identifier&rsquo;s <code>close</code>
        function decrements the reference count
        for the identifier which normally closes the object, but
        if the reference count for the identifier has been incremented with
        <code>H5Iinc_ref</code>, the object will only be closed when the
        reference count
        reaches zero with further calls to this function or the
        object identifier&rsquo;s <code>close</code> function.

        <p>
        If the object identifier was created by a collective parallel call 
        (such as <code>H5Dcreate</code>, <code>H5Gopen</code>, etc.), 
        the reference count should be modified by all the processes which 
        have copies of the identifier.  Generally this means that 
        group, dataset, attribute, file, and committed datatype identifiers 
        should be modified by all the processes and that all other 
        types of identifiers are safe to modify by individual processes.

        <p>
        This function is of particular value when an application is 
        maintaining multiple copies of an object identifier.  
        The object identifier can be incremented when a copy is made.  
        Each copy of the identifier can then be safely closed or
        decremented and the HDF5 object will be closed when the 
        reference count for that that object drops to zero.
