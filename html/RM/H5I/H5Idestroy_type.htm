<dl>
<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Identify-DestroyType">H5Idestroy_type</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Idestroy_type</code>(
            <em>H5I_type_t</em> <code>type</code>
            )
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Removes the type <code>type</code> and all identifiers within that type.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Idestroy_type</code> deletes an entire identifier type.  
        All identifiers of this type are destroyed and no new identifiers of 
        this type can be registered.

        <p>
        The type&rsquo;s free function is called on all of the identifiers 
        which are deleted by this function, freeing their memory.  
        In addition, all memory used by this type&rsquo;s hash table is freed.

        <p>
        Since the <em>H5I_type_t</em> values of destroyed identifier types 
        are reused when new types are registered, 
        it is a good idea to set the variable holding the value 
        of the destroyed type to <code>H5I_UNINIT</code>.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
	  <tr>
              <td valign="top"><em>H5I_type_t</em>&nbsp;<code>type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code></td>
              <td valign="top">IN: Identifier of identifier type 
                  which is to be destroyed</td>
	  </tr>
    </table></ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
        <dd>Returns non-negative on success, negative on failure.
<dt><strong>Fortran90 Interface:</strong>
        <dd>None.
