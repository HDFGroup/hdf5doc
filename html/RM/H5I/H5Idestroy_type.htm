<dl>
<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Identify-DestroyType">H5Idestroy_type</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Idestroy_type</code>(
            <em>H5I_type_t</em> <code>type</code>
            )
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Removes the type <code>type</code> and all IDs within that type.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Idestroy_type</code> deletes an entire ID type.  
        All IDs of this type are destroyed and no new IDs of this type 
        can be registered.

        <p>
        The type’s free function is called on all of the IDs which 
        are deleted by this function, freeing their memory.  
        In addition, all memory used by this type’s hash table is freed.

        <p>
        Since the <em>H5I_type_t</em> values of destroyed ID types 
        are reused when new types are registered, 
        it is a good idea to set the variable holding the value 
        of the destroyed type to <code>H5I_UNINIT</code>.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
	  <tr>
              <td valign="top"><em>H5I_type_t</em>&nbsp;<code>type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code></td>
              <td valign="top">IN: Identifier of ID type 
                  which is to be destroyed</td>
	  </tr>
    </table></ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
        <dd>Returns non-negative on success, negative on failure.
<dt><strong>Fortran90 Interface:</strong>
        <dd>This function is not supported in FORTRAN 90.
