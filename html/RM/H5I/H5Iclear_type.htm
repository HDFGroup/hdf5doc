<dl>
<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Identify-ClearType">H5Iclear_type</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Iclear_type</code>(
            <em>H5I_type_t</em> <code>type</code>, 
            <em>hbool_t</em> <code>force</code>
            )
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Deletes all IDs of the given type
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Iclear_type</code> deletes all IDs of the type identified by the argument type.
        <p>
        The type’s free function is first called on all of these 
        IDs to free their memory, then they are removed from the type.

        <p>
        If the <code>force</code> flag is set to false, only those 
        IDs whose reference counts are equal to 1 will be deleted, 
        and all other IDs will be entirely unchanged.  
        If the <code>force</code> flag is true, 
        all IDs of this type will be deleted.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><em>H5I_type_t</em>&nbsp;<code>type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code></td>
    	<td valign="top">IN: Identifier of ID type which 
            is to be cleared of IDs</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><em>hbool_t</em> <code>force</code></td>
    	<td valign="top">IN: Whether or not to force deletion of all IDs</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
        <dd>Returns non-negative on success, negative on failure.
<dt><strong>Fortran90 Interface:</strong>
        <dd>This function is not supported in FORTRAN 90.
