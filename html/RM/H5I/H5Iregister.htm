<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Identify-Register">H5Iregister</a>
<p>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>hid_t</em> <code>H5Iregister</code>(
            <em>H5I_type_t</em> <code>type</code>, 
            <em>void *</em><code>object</code>
            )
<p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Creates and returns a new ID.
<p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Iregister</code> allocates space for a new ID 
        and returns an identifier for it.
	
        <p>
        The <code>type</code> parameter is the identifier for 
        the ID type to which this new ID will belong.  
        This identifier must have been created by a call to 
        <code>H5Iregister_type</code>.

        <p>
        The <code>object</code> parameter is a pointer to the memory 
        which the new ID will be a reference to.  
        This pointer will be stored by the library and 
        returned to you via a call to <code>H5Iobject_verify</code>.

  <p>
  <dt><strong>Programming Note for C++ Developers Using C Functions:</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>If a C routine that takes a function pointer as an argument is 
      called from within C++ code, the C routine should be returned from 
      normally. </p>

      <p>Examples of this kind of routine include callbacks such as 
      <code>H5Pset_elink_cb</code> and <code>H5Pset_type_conv_cb</code> 
      and functions such as <code>H5Tconvert</code> and 
      <code>H5Ewalk2</code>.</p>

      <p>Exiting the routine in its normal fashion allows the HDF5 C 
      Library to clean up its work properly. In other words, if the C++ 
      application jumps out of the routine back to the C++ 
      &ldquo;catch&rdquo; statement, the library is not given the 
      opportunity to close any temporary data structures that were set 
      up when the routine was called. The C++ application should save 
      some state as the routine is started so that any problem that 
      occurs might be diagnosed.</p>
