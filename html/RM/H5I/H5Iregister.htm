<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Identify-Register">H5Iregister</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>hid_t</em> <code>H5Iregister</code>(
            <em>H5I_type_t</em> <code>type</code>, 
            <em>void *</em><code>object</code>
            )
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Creates and returns a new ID.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Iregister</code> allocates space for a new ID 
        and returns an identifier for it.
	
        <p>
        The <code>type</code> parameter is the identifier for 
        the ID type to which this new ID will belong.  
        This identifier must have been created by a call to 
        <code>H5Iregister_type</code>.

        <p>
        The <code>object</code> parameter is a pointer to the memory 
        which the new ID will be a reference to.  
        This pointer will be stored by the library and 
        returned to you via a call to <code>H5Iobject_verify</code>.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign="top"><em>H5I_type_t</em>&nbsp;<code>type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code></td>
            <td valign="top">IN: The identifier of the type to 
                which the new ID will belong</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td valign="top"><em>void *</em><code>object</code></td>
            <td valign="top">IN: Pointer to memory for the library to store</td>
	  </tr>
    </table></ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
        <dd>Returns the new ID on success, negative on failure.
<dt><strong>Fortran90 Interface:</strong>
        <dd>This function is not supported in FORTRAN 90.
