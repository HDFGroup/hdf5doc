<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Library-DontAtExit">H5dont_atexit</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5dont_atexit</code>(<em>void</em>)
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Instructs library not to install <code>atexit</code> cleanup routine.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5dont_atexit</code> indicates to the library that an 
        <code>atexit()</code> cleanup routine should not be installed.  
        The major purpose for this is in situations where the 
        library is dynamically linked into an application and is 
        un-linked from the application before <code>exit()</code> gets 
        called.  In those situations, a routine installed with 
        <code>atexit()</code> would jump to a routine which was 
        no longer in memory, causing errors.
        <p>
        In order to be effective, this routine <em>must</em> be called 
        before any other HDF function calls, and must be called each 
        time the library is loaded/linked into the application 
        (the first time and after it's been un-loaded).
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dl>
        <dt>None.
    </dl>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful;
        otherwise returns a negative value.
