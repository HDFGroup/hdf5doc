<dt><strong>Name:</strong> 
    <a name="Library-FreeMemory">H5free_memory</a></dt>
    <br />

<dt><strong>Signature:</strong></dt>
    <dd><code><em>herr_t</em> H5free_memory(<em>void</em> *buf)</code></dd>
    <br />

<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong></dt>
    <dd>Frees memory allocated by the HDF5 Library.</dd>
    <br />

<dt><strong>Description:</strong></dt>
    <dd>In order to avoid heap corruption, allocated memory should be 
    freed using the same library that initially allocated it. In most 
    cases, the HDF5 API uses resources that are allocated and freed 
    entirely by either the user or the library. In some cases, however, 
    HDF5 API calls will allocate memory that the user must free 
    (for example, <code>H5Tget_member_name</code>). 
    <code>H5free_memory</code> allows the user to safely free this 
    memory.</dd>
    <br />

<dt><strong>Notes:</strong></dt>
    <dd>It is especially important to use this function to free memory 
    allocated by the library on Windows. The C standard library is 
    implemented in dynamic link libraries (dlls) known as the C run-time 
    (CRT). Each version of Visual Studio comes with two CRT dlls 
    (debug and release) and allocating and freeing across dll boundaries 
    can cause resource leaks and subtle bugs due to heap corruption.
    
    <p>Only use this function to free memory allocated by the library. 
    It will generally not be safe to use this function to free memory 
    allocated by any other means.</p>
    
    <p>Even when using this function, it is still best to ensure that all 
    components of a C application are built with the same version of 
    Visual Studio and build (debug or release) and thus linked against 
    the same CRT.</p></dd>
