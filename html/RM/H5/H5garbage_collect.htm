<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Library-GarbageCollect">H5garbage_collect</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5garbage_collect</code>(<em>void</em>)

<p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Garbage collects on all free-lists of all types.

<p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5garbage_collect</code> walks through all the garbage 
        collection routines of the library, freeing any unused memory. 
        <p>
        It is not required that <code>H5garbage_collect</code> be called 
        at any particular time; it is only necessary in certain situations 
        where the application has performed actions that cause the library 
        to allocate many objects.  The application should call
        <code>H5garbage_collect</code> if it eventually releases those 
        objects and wants to reduce the memory used by the library from
        the peak usage required.  
        <p>
        The library automatically garbage collects all the free lists 
        when the application ends.

<p>
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd>
        None.
    </dd>

<p>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful;
        otherwise returns a negative value.
