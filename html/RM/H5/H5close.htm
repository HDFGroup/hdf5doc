<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Library-Close">H5close</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5close</code>(<em>void</em>)

<p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Flushes all data to disk, closes all open identifiers, and cleans up memory.

<p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5close</code> flushes all data to disk, 
        closes all open HDF5 identifiers, and cleans up all memory used by
        the HDF5 library.  This function is generally called when the 
        application calls <code>exit()</code>, but may be called earlier 
        in the event of an emergency shutdown or out of a desire to free all 
        resources used by the HDF5 library.
        <p>
        <code>h5open_f</code> and <code>h5close_f</code> are 
        required calls in Fortran90 applications.	

<p>
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd>None.

<p>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful;
        otherwise returns a negative value.

<p>
<dt><strong>Fortran90 Interface:</strong> h5close_f
    <dd>

SUBROUTINE h5close_f(hdferr)

  INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: hdferr      ! Error code
