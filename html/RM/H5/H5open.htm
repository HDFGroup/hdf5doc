<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Library-Open">H5open</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5open</code>(<em>void</em>)

<p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Initializes the HDF5 library.

<p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5open</code> initialize the library.  
        <p>
        When the HDF5 Library is employed in a C application,
        this function is normally called automatically, but if you 
        find that an HDF5 library function is failing inexplicably, 
        try calling this function first.
        If you wish to elimnate this possibility, it is safe to 
        routinely call <code>H5open</code> before an application 
        starts working with the library as there are no damaging 
        side-effects in calling it more than once.
        <p>
        When the HDF5 Library is employed in a Fortran90 application,
        <code>h5open_f</code> initializes global variables 
        (for example, predefined types) and performs other tasks required 
        to initialize the HDF5 Fortran Library.
        <code>h5open_f</code> and <code>h5close_f</code> are 
        required calls in HDF5 Fortran applications.

<p>
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd>None.

<p>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful;
        otherwise returns a negative value.

<p>
<dt><strong>Fortran90 Interface:</strong> h5open_f
