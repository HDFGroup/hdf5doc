<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="File-ResetMdcHitRateStats">H5Freset_mdc_hit_rate_stats</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Freset_mdc_hit_rate_stats</code>(<em>hid_t</em> 
      <code>file_id</code>)
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Reset hit rate statistics counters for the target file.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd>H5Freset_mdc_hit_rate_stats resets the hit rate statistics 
      counters in the metadata cache associated with the specified 
      file. 
      <p>If the adaptive cache resizing code is enabled, the hit 
      rate statistics are reset at the beginning of each epoch.  
      This API call allows you to do the same thing from your program. 
      <p>The adaptive cache resizing code may behave oddly if you use 
      this call when adaptive cache resizing is enabled.  However, 
      the call should be useful if you choose to control metadata 
      cache size from your program. 
      <p>See the overview of the metadata cache in the special topics 
      section of the user manual for details of the metadata cache and 
      the adaptive cache resizing algorithms.  If you haven't read, 
      understood, and thought about the material covered in that 
      documentation, you shouldn't be using this API call.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top"><em>hid_t</em>&nbsp;<code>file_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code></td>
            <td valign="top">IN: Identifier of the target file.</td></tr>
    </table></ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful; otherwise returns a 
      negative value.
