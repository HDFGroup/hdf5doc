<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Fget_mdc_image_info</code>(<em>hid_t</em> 
      <code>file_id</code>, 
      <em>haddr_t</em> <code>*image_addr</code>,
      <em>hsize_t</em> <code>*image_len</code>)
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>

    <dd>Obtain information about a cache image if it exists.</dd>

<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Fget_mdc_image_info</code> returns information about a cache
    image if it exists.
    <p>
    When an HDF5 file is opened in Read/Write mode, any metadata cache image will be 
    read and deleted from the file on the first metadata cache access (or, if 
    persistent  free  space  managers  are  enabled,  on  the  first  file space
    allocation / deallocation, or read of free space manager status, whichever comes 
    first).  
    <p>Thus, if the file is opened Read/Write, <code>H5Fget_mdc_image_info</code> should 
    be called immediately after file open and before any other operation. If 
    <code>H5Fget_mdc_image_info</code> is called after the cache image is loaded, it 
    will correctly report that no cache image exists, as the image will have already been 
    read and deleted from the file.  In the Read Only case, the function may be called at any
    time, as any cache image will not be deleted from the file.
