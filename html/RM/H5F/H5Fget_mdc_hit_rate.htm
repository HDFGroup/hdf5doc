<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="File-GetMdcHitRate">H5Fget_mdc_hit_rate</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t</em> <code>H5Fget_mdc_hit_rate</code>(<em>hid_t</em> 
      <code>file_id</code>, <em>double *</em><code>hit_rate_ptr</code>)
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Obtain target file's metadata cache hit rate.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd>H5Fget_mdc_hit_rate queries the metadata cache of the target 
      file to obtain its hit rate (cache hits / (cache hits + cache misses)) 
      since the last time hit rate statistics were reset.  If the cache has 
      not been accessed since the last time the hit rate stats were reset, 
      the hit rate is defined to be 0.0.
      <p>The hit rate stats can be reset either manually (via 
      H5Freset_mdc_hit_rate_stats()), or automatically.  If the cache's 
      adaptive resize code is enabled, the hit rate stats will be reset 
      once per epoch.  If they are reset manually as well, 
      the cache may behave oddly.
      <p>See the overview of the metadata cache in the special 
      topics section of the user manual for details on the metadata 
      cache and its adaptive resize algorithms.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul><table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top"><em>hid_t</em> <code>file_id</code></td>
            <td valign="top">IN: Identifier of the target file.</td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top"><em>double&nbsp;*</em>&nbsp;<code>hit_rate_ptr</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
            <td valign="top">OUT: Pointer to the double in which the 
              hit rate is returned.  Note that *<code>hit_rate_ptr</code> is 
              undefined if the API call fails.</td></tr>
    </table></ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns a non-negative value if successful; otherwise 
      returns a negative value.
