<h1>API Compatibility Macros in HDF5</h1>
</div>

<h3>Audience</h3>
The target audience for this document has existing applications
that use the HDF5 Library, and is considering moving to 
HDF5 Release 1.10.x  to take advantage of the latest library 
features and enhancements.

<h3>Compatibility Issues</h3>
HDF5 Release 1.10.0 is a major update of the HDF5 Library. 
Certain compatibility issues must be considered when migrating 
applications from an earlier major release series, such as 1.8.x or 1.6.x,
to a HDF5 1.10.x release.
<p>
This document, &ldquo;<cite>API Compatibility Macros in HDF5</cite>,&rdquo; 
describes the approach taken by The HDF Group in HDF5 Release 1.10.0 to 
help existing users of HDF5 address compatibility issues in the HDF5 API. 
A companion document,
<a href="/HDF5/docNewFeatures/index.html"><cite>New Features in 
HDF5 Release 1.10.0</cite></a>, discusses 
    features introduced in HDF5 Release 1.10.0 and 
    the HDF5 API calls associated with those features. 
<!--
The companion document,
<a href="../ADGuide/CompatFormat180.html"><cite>New Features in 
HDF5 Release 1.10.0 and Format Compatibility Considerations</cite></a>,
discusses 
    features introduced in HDF5 Release 1.10.0, 
    the HDF5 API calls associated with those features, 
    and the potential file format compatibility issues that may 
      result if the new features are used.
-->

<h3>Summary and Motivation</h3>
In response to new and evolving requirements for the library and
data format, several basic functions have changed since HDF5 was first
released.
To allow existing applications to continue to compile and run properly, 
all versions of these functions have been retained in the later
releases of the HDF5 Library.
<p>
HDF5 Release 1.10.0 includes a number of new features that offer
users of HDF5 substantial performance improvements and expanded
capabilities.  Some of these features can only be accessed via 
revised API calls.   Given the scope of the changes, and recognizing
the potentially time-consuming task of editing all the affected calls
in user applications, The HDF Group has created a set of macros that can be
used to flexibly and easily map existing API calls to either 1.6.x, 1.8.x,
or 1.10.x functions.  
We refer to these as the <em>API compatibility macros</em>.
<p>
The HDF Group generally encourages users to update applications 
to work with the latest HDF5 Library release so that 
all new features and enhancements are available to them.
At the same time, The HDF Group understands that, under some circumstances,
updating applications may not be feasible or necessary.
The API compatibility macros, described in this document,
provide a bridge from old APIs to new 
and can be particularly helpful in situations such as these:
<ul>
    <li>Source code is not available - only binaries are available;
        updating the application is not feasible. 
    <li>Source code is available, but there are no resources to update it.
    <li>Source code is available, as are resources to update it, 
        but the old version works quite well so updates are not a priority.
        At the same time, it is desirable to take advantage of 
        certain efficiencies in the newer HDF5 release that do not require
        code changes.
    <li>Source code is available, as are resources to update it, but 
        the applications are large or complex, and must continue to run 
        while the code updates are carried out.
</ul>

<!-- NEW PAGE -->
<h3>Understanding and Using the Macros</h3>

As part of HDF5 Release 1.10.0, two functions that existed in 
previous versions of the library were updated with new calling
parameters and given new names. 
The updated versions of the functions have a &lsquo;2&rsquo; at the end of the 
original function name.
The original versions of these functions were retained and renamed to have 
a &lsquo;1&rsquo; at the end of the original function name.   
In one case, <code>H5Fget_info</code>, the change is in the struct employed 
by the function.  In this case, the struct was versioned in exactly the
same manner as the function. 
API compatibility macros, with the same names as the original
function and struct names, were then created.

<p>
Note that twenty-three versioned functions and corresponding macros 
were introduced in HDF5 Release 1.8.0.
These functions and macros were created in exactly the same manner discussed 
in the preceding paragraph.

<p>
Concretely, consider the function <code>H5Rdereference</code> 
in HDF5 releases prior to 1.10.0:

<p>

<ul>
Original function name and signature, in releases prior to 1.10.0:
<br>
    <code>
    <em>hid_t</em> H5Rdereference( 
                   <em>hid_t</em> <code>obj_id</code>,
                   <em>H5R_type_t</em> <code>ref_type</code>,
                   <em>void *</em><code>ref</code>
                   ) </code>
<br><br>
Updated function and signature, introduced in release 1.10.0:
<br>
    <code>
    <em>hid_t</em> H5Rdereference2( 
                   <em>hid_t</em> <code>obj_id</code>,
                   <em>hid_t</em> <code>oapl_id</code>,
                   <em>H5R_type_t</em> <code>ref_type</code>,
                   <em>void *</em><code>ref</code>
                   ) </code>

<br> <br>
Original function and signature, renamed in release 1.10.0:
<br>
    <code>
    <em>hid_t</em> H5Rdereference1( 
                   <em>hid_t</em> <code>obj_id</code>,
                   <em>H5R_type_t</em> <code>ref_type</code>,
                   <em>void *</em><code>ref</code>
                   ) </code>
<br><br>
API compatibility macro, introduced in release 1.10.0:
<br>
    <code> H5Rdereference </code>
</ul>

The macro, <code>H5Rdereference</code>, will be mapped to either 
<code>H5Rdereference1</code> or <code>H5Rdereference2</code>.  
The mapping is determined by a combination of the 
configuration options use to build the HDF5 Library 
and compile-time options used to build the application.
The calling parameters used with the <code>H5Rdereference</code> 
compatibility macro should match the number and type of the 
function the macros will be mapped to
(<code>H5Rdereference1</code> or <code>H5Rdereference2</code>).
<p>
The function names ending in &lsquo;1&rsquo; or &lsquo;2&rsquo; 
are referred to as <em>versioned names</em>, and
the corresponding functions are referred to as <em>versioned functions</em>.
For new code development, The HDF Group recommends use of the 
compatibility macro mapped to the latest version of the function.
The original versions of these functions, with names ending in 
&lsquo;1&rsquo;, should be considered deprecated and, in general, 
should not be used when developing new code.

<a name="GlobalSettings">&nbsp;</a>
<p>
<strong>Compatibility Macro Mapping Options</strong>

<p>
To determine the mapping for a given API compatibility macro in a 
given application,
a combination of user-controlled selections,
collectively referred to as the 
<em>compatibility macro mapping options</em>,
is considered in the following sequence:

<table border="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width="50%" valign="top">

<ol>
  <li> What compatibility macro configuration option was used to
       build the HDF5 Library?  
       We refer to this selection as the <em>library mapping</em>.

  <br />&nbsp;
  <li> Was a compatibility macro global compile-time option specified
       when the application was built?
       We refer to this (optional) selection as the 
       <em>application mapping</em>.  
       If an application mapping exists, it overrides the library 
       mapping. 
       <i>(See adjacent <a href="#KnownLimitation">notes</a>.)</i>

  <br />&nbsp;
  <li> Were any compatibility macro function-level compile-time options
       specified when the application was built?  
       We refer to these (optional) selections as <em>function mappings</em>.
       If function mappings exist, they override library and application
       mappings for the relevant API compatibility macros.
       <i>(See adjacent <a href="#KnownLimitation">notes</a>.)</i>
</ol>

</td><td width="50%" valign="top">

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" width="100%">
<tr><td>
<a name="KnownLimitation"><b>Notes:</b></a>
       An application mapping can map APIs to the same version 
       or to a version older than the configured library mapping. 
       When the application attempts to map APIs to a newer version of 
       the API than the library was configured with, it will fail to 
       &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; the mapping
       (and may fail silently). 
       <p>
       When it is necessary to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; the macro mappings
       from those set in the library mapping, it must be done at 
       the per-function level, using the function-level mappings. 
       As long as one does not try to map a function to a version 
       that was compiled out in the library mapping, 
       individual functions can be upgraded or downgraded freely. 
</td></tr>
</table>

</td></tr>
</table>


<p>
The tables that follow summarize the macro mapping behaviors, and the
configuration and compile-time options that control the mappings.  
The macro <code>H5Rdereference</code> is used to demonstrate mapping behavior.
<p>
Regardless of the macro mapping options used,
the 1.10.x functions will always be available 
by explicitly calling the versioned functions 
by their versioned names.
For example, <code>H5Rdereference2</code>.
Through the compatibility macro mapping options provided, it is possible to 
disallow calls to the deprecated 1.8.x functions, 
such as <code>H5Rdereference1</code>.
This capability can be used to guarantee that only the 
most recent versions of the functions are being called.

<p>
<strong>Library Mapping Options</strong>

<p>
When the HDF5 Library is built, <code>configure</code> flags can be
used to control the API compatibility macro mapping behavior 
exhibited by the library. This behavior can be overridden by application 
and function mappings.  One configure flag excludes deprecated functions
from the HDF5 Library, making them unavailable to applications linked with
the library.

      <td>
        no
</table>    
</div>

<p>
Refer to the file <code>libhdf5.settings</code> in the directory where
the HDF5 Library is installed to determine the <code>configure</code> 
flags used to build the library.
In particular, look for the two lines shown here:
<ul>
    <code>
    Default Version of Public Symbols:  v110
    <br>
    With Deprecated Public Symbols:  Yes
    </code>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Application Mapping Options</strong>

<p>
When an application using HDF5 APIs is built and linked with the HDF5 Library, 
compile-time options to <code>h5cc</code> can be
used to control the API compatibility macro mapping behavior 
exhibited by the application. 
The application mapping overrides the behavior specified by the library mapping, 
and can be overridden on a function-by-function basis by the function mappings.
<p>
If the HDF5 Library was configured with the 
<code>--disable-deprecated-symbols</code> flag,
then the deprecated functions will not be available, regardless of the
application mapping options.

      <td>
        no
</table>    
</div>

<p>
<strong>Function Mapping Options</strong>

<p>
Function mappings are specified when the application is built. 
These mappings can be used to control the 
mapping of the API compatibility macros 
to underlying functions on a function-by-function basis.
The function mappings override the library and application mappings
discussed earlier.
<p>
If the HDF5 Library was configured with the 
<code>--disable-deprecated-symbols</code> flag, 
or <code>-DH5_NO_DEPRECATED_SYMBOLS</code> is used to compile the application,
then the deprecated functions will not be available, regardless of the
function mapping options.

<p>
For every function with multiple available versions, a compile-time 
version flag can be defined to selectively map the function macro 
to the desired versioned function.  
For example, the <code>H5Rdereference</code> macro
can be mapped to either <code>H5Rdereference1</code> or
<code>H5Rdereference2</code>.
When used, the value of the 
<code>H5Rdereference_vers</code> compile-time version flag determines
which function will be called:
<ul>
    <li>When <code>H5Rdereference_vers</code> is set to <code>1</code>,
        the macro <code>H5Rdereference</code> will be mapped to
        <code>H5Rdereference1</code>. 
        <br>
        <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        h5cc ... -DH5Rdereference_vers=1 ...</code>
        <p>
    <li>When <code>H5Rdereference_vers</code> is set to <code>2</code>,
        the macro <code>H5Rdereference</code> will be mapped to
        <code>H5Rdereference2</code>. 
        <br>
        <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        h5cc ... -DH5Rdereference_vers=2 ...</code>
        <p>
    <li>When <code>H5Rdereference_vers</code> is not set,
        the macro <code>H5Rdereference</code> will be mapped to
        either 
        <code>H5Rdereference1</code>
        or
        <code>H5Rdereference2</code>,
        based on the application mapping, if one was specified,
        or on the library mapping.
        <br>
        <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        h5cc ... </code>
        <p>
</ul>

At release 1.10.0, 
The following table lists the new API compatibility macros, 
function and struct mapping compile-time version flags and values,
and corresponding versioned functions and struct that were 
introduced at HDF5 Release 1.10.0.
If the application being compiled to run with any 1.10.x release
was written to use any 1.8.x release of HDF5, 
these are the only macros you need to worry about.

At release 1.8.0, the API compatibility macros,

<p>
See the 
<a href="RM_H5Front.html">HDF5 Reference Manual</a>&nbsp;
for complete descriptions of all API compatibility macros and 
versioned functions shown in Table 3 (and Table 4, if the application 
in question was written for a 1.6.x version of HDF5).
<p>
It is possible to specify multiple function mappings for a single 
application build:
<ul>
<code> h5cc ... -DH5Rdereference_vers=1 -DH5Fget_info_vers=2 ...</code>
</ul>
As a result of the function and struct mappings in this compile example, 
all occurrences of the macro <code>H5Rdereference</code> 
will be mapped to <code>H5Rdereference1</code> and 
all occurrences of the macro <code>H5Fget_info</code> 
will be mapped to <code>H5Fget_info2</code>
for the application being built.  
<p>
The function and struct mappings can be used to guarantee that a given
API compatibility macro will be mapped to the desired underlying function
or struct version regardless of the library or application mappings.
In cases where an application may benefit greatly from features offered by
some of the later APIs, or must continue to use some earlier API versions for
compatibility reasons, this fine-grained control may be very important.

<p>
As noted earlier, the function mappings can only reference versioned
functions that are included in the HDF5 Library,
as determined by the configure flag used to build the library.   
For example, if the HDF5 Library being linked with the application was built 
with the <code>--disable-deprecated-symbols</code> option, version 1 of the 
underlying functions would not be available, and the example above 
that defined <code>H5Rdereference_ver=1</code> would not be supported.

<p>
The function mappings do not negate any available functions.
If <code>H5Rdereference1</code> is available in the installed version of the
HDF5 Library, 
and the application was not compiled with the 
<code>-DH5_NO_DEPRECATED_SYMBOLS</code> flag,
the function <code>H5Rdereference1</code> will remain available to 
the application through its versioned name.
Similarly, <code>H5Rdereference2</code> will remain available to the 
application as <code>H5Rdereference2</code>.
The function mapping version flag <code>H5Rdereference_vers</code> 
only controls the mapping of the API compatibility macro
<code>H5Rdereference</code> to one of the two available functions.
<p>
This can be especially useful in any case where the programmer does not have
direct control over global macro definitions, such as when writing code meant 
to be copied to multiple applications or when writing code in a header file.

<h3>Compatibility Macros in HDF5 1.6.8 and Later</h3>
A series of similar compatibility macros were introduced into
the release 1.6 series of the library, starting with release 1.6.8.
These macros simply alias the &lsquo;1&rsquo; version functions, callbacks, 
and typedefs listed above to their original non-numbered names.
<p>
These macros were strictly a forward-looking feature at that time; 
they were not necessary for compatibility in 1.6.x.
These macros were created at that time to enable writing code 
that could be used with any version of the library after 1.6.8 
and any library compilation options except
<code>H5_NO_DEPRECATED_SYMBOLS</code>, by always using the &lsquo;1&rsquo; 
version of versioned functions and types.  
For example, <code>H5Rdereference1</code> will always be interpreted 
in exactly the same manner by any version of the library since 1.6.8.

<h3>Common Use Case</h3>

A common scenario where the API compatibility macros may be helpful
is the migration of an existing application to HDF5 Release 1.10.0.
An incremental migration plan is outlined here:

<ol>
<li>
Build the HDF5 Library without specifying any library mapping 
<code>configure</code> flag.
In this default mode, the 1.6.x, 1.8.x, and 1.10.x versions of the 
underlying functions are available, and the API compatibility macros 
will be mapped to the 1.10.x versioned functions.  For example, 
<code>H5Rdereference</code> will be mapped to <code>H5Rdereference2</code>
and <code>H5Gcreate</code> will be mapped to <code>H5Gcreate2</code>.
<p>
<li>
Compile the application with the <code>-DH5_USE_18_API</code> application 
mapping option if it was written for use with an HDF5 Release 1.8.x library
(or with <code>-DH5_USE_16_API</code> if it was written for use with 1.6.x)
and link with the HDF5 Library built in step 1.   
No changes should be required to build the application.  
The API compatibility macros, for example <code>H5Rdereference</code>, 
replace the actual function names that were used in versions of the library 
prior to 1.10.0.  
Because the application mapping overrides the library mapping, the macros 
will all be mapped to the 1.8.x (or 1.6.x) versions of the functions.
<p>
<li>
Remap one API compatibility macro at a time (or sets of macros), 
to use the 1.10.x versions. 
At each stage, use the function mappings to map the macros being worked on 
to the 1.10.x versions.   
For example, use the <code>-DH5Rdereference_vers=2</code> 
version flag setting to remap the <code>H5Rdereference</code> macro to 
<code>H5Rdereference2</code>, the 1.10.x version.
<p>
During this step, the application code will need to be modified to change 
the calling parameters used with the API compatibility macros 
to match the number and type of the 1.10.x versioned functions.  
The macro name, for example <code>H5Rdereference</code>, should continue 
to be used in the code, to allow for possible re-mappings 
to later versioned functions in a future release.
<p>
<li>
After all macros have been migrated to the 1.10.x versioned functions in 
step 3, compile the application without any application or function mappings.  
This build uses the library mappings set in step 1, and maps
API compatibility macros to the 1.10.x versions.
<p>
<li>
Finally, compile the application with the application mapping 
<code>-DH5_NO_DEPRECATED_SYMBOLS</code>,
and address any failures to complete the application migration process.    
</ol>
