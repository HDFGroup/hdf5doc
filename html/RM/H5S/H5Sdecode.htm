<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Dataspace-Decode">H5Sdecode</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>hid_t</em> <code>H5Sdecode</code>
      (<em>unsigned char *</em><code>buf</code>)
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Decode a binary object description of data space and 
      return a new object handle.
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd>Given an object description of data space in binary in a 
      buffer, <code>H5Sdecode</code> reconstructs the HDF5 data 
      type object and returns a new object handle for it.  The binary 
      description of the object is encoded by <code>H5Sencode</code>.  
      User is responsible for passing in the right buffer.
      The types of data space we address in this function are null, 
      scalar, and simple space.  For simple data space, the information of 
      selection, for example, hyperslab selection, is also encoded and 
      decoded.  Complex data space has not been implemented in the 
      library.
<dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <ul>
      <table>
        <tr>
	  <td valign="top"><em>unsigned&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</em><code>buf</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
          <td valign="top">IN: Buffer for the data space object 
	    to be decoded.</td></tr>
      </table>
    </ul>
<dt><strong>Returns:</strong>
    <dd>Returns an object ID(non-negative) if successful; 
      otherwise returns a negative value.
