  <dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="Group-Unlink">H5Gunlink</a>
  <dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>herr_t </em><code>H5Gunlink</code>(<em>hid_t</em> <code>loc_id</code>,
        <em>const char *</em><code>name</code>
    )
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Removes the link to an object from a group. 
  <dt><strong>Notice:</strong>
    <dd><i>This function is deprecated in favor of the function 
        <a href="RM_H5L.html#Link-Delete"><code>H5Ldelete</code></a>.</i>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Gunlink</code> removes the object specified by 
        <code>name</code> from the group graph and decrements the 
        link count for the object to which <code>name</code> points.
        This action eliminates any association between <code>name</code>
        and the object to which <code>name</code> pointed.
        <p>
        Object headers keep track of how many hard links refer to an object;
        when the link count reaches zero, the object can be removed  
        from the file.  Objects which are open are not removed until all  
        identifiers to the object are closed.
        <p>
        If the link count reaches zero, all file space associated with 
        the object will be released, i.e., identified in memory as freespace.
        If any object identifier is open for the object, the space
        will not be released until after the object identifier is closed.
        <p>
        Note that space identified as freespace is available for re-use 
        only as long as the file remains open; once a file has been 
        closed, the HDF5 library loses track of freespace.  See
        &ldquo;<a href="../H5.user/Performance.html#Freespace">Freespace Management</a>&rdquo;
        in the <cite>HDF5 User's Guide</cite> for further details.
  <dt><strong>Warning:</strong>
    <dd>Exercise care in unlinking groups as it is possible to render data in 
        a file inaccessible with <code>H5Gunlink</code>.  
        See <a href="../H5.user/Groups.html#H5GUnlinkToCorrupt">The Group Interface</a> 
        in the <cite>HDF5 User's Guide</cite>.
