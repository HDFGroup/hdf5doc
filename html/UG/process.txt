PDF versions of the HDF5 Reference Manual (RM) and the new HDF5 User's Guide 
(UG) are created from the HTML source at each release of the HDF5 Library.  
The process is managed through two application environments, DreamWeaver (an 
HTML editing environment) and HTMLdoc (a PDF conversion tool).  This document 
describes the process in detail for the UG; the process for the RM is very 
similar and is described in a separate document.


Complete this process first for either the RM or UG, then for the other.


The HDF5 User's Guide
-------------------------
1.  Skip this step if you have already done it for the UG; you can use the 
    same working copy for both tasks.

    Check out a fresh working copy of the minor release branch specifically
    for this task. For example:
      svn checkout https://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/hdf5doc/branches/hdf5_1_8_4  \
          hdf5_1_8_4-PDFs

    Using Macromedia Dreamweaver, define a site that contains all the 
    documents within the subdirectory html/, including the .html, image, 
    DreamWeaver library (in ed_libs/), and .book files.

2.  Working in DreamWeaver...
    In the ed_libs directory:

      a) Assuming your libraries are set up for electronic viewing (to
         verify, check that there is nothing more than a commented note and
         an '&nbsp;' in the ed_libs/*_Null.lbi libraries), move the code
         from the relevant library files into the respective _Null library 
         files, replacing the &nbsp;.
           
         For example, take all the code from Footer.lbi and insert it into
         Footer_Null.lbi, taking care not to remove the commented note.

         You can ignore any file in ed_libs/ that does not have a corresponding 
         _Null file.

      b) In the now empty library file, add an &nbsp;.

      c) Save the libraries and their respective Null files.

      d) With a library still open (not a Null one) choose 
          Modify>Templates>Update Pages...
         In 'Look in:', select 'Entire Site'.
         In 'Update:', select 'Library Items' and 
                       deselect 'Templates'.
         Click on the 'Start' button.

3.  If you have not yet generated the RM PDF, perform the task outlined in
    step three of the RM process.txt file.  This is the step of converting 
    the '!-- FOR USE WITH...' flags from the electronic form to the print form.

         <!-- FOR USE WITH ELECTRONIC VERSION ---> 
         <!-- FOR USE WITH PRINT VERSION ---> 

4.  Using HTMLdoc:  
      
      a) Open H5_newUG.book 
      
      b) The Input tab:

           Output Format: PDF
           Output Options: JPEG Big Images
           Compression (not critical, change at will): Slider right above 'Fast'
           JPEG Quality (not critical, change at will): 60
  
      d) The Page tab:
           Page Size: Letter, 2-Sided
             Top: 0.50in, Left: 1.00in, Right: 0.50in, Bottom: 0.50in
           Header: Blank, Blank, Blank
           Footer: Blank, Blank, 1,2,3,...
           Number Up: 1

      e) The Colors tab:
           Everything Blank
           Link Style: Plain
    
      f) The Fonts tab:
           Base Font Size: 11.0
           Line Spacing: 1.2
           Body Typeface: Times
           Heading Typeface: Helvetica
           Header/Footer Size: 10.0
           Header/Footer Font: Helvetica
           Character Set: iso-8859-1
           Options: Do Not Check 'Embed Fonts'

      g) The PDF tab:
           PDF Version: 1.3
           Page Mode: Document
           Page Layout: Single
           Page Effect: None
           Options: Check 'Include Links'

      h) The Security tab:
           Encryption: No

      i) The Options tab:
           HTML Editor: Point to Dreamweaver (recommended)
           Browser Width: 680
           GUI Option: Check all 3

      j) Save the book file.
     
      k) Verify that the output file (HDF5_UG_body.pdf) is not open.

      l) Generate the document.

5.  Open HDF5_UG_body.pdf
    
      a) Scan through the document page by page to verify that there are no 
         elements that should have been eliminated via javascripts, swapped 
         comment markup, or swapped DW library content.

      b) Scan through again looking only for places where page breaks need to 
         be added, removed, or relocated.  (Note that in the UG, it is 
         sometimes useful to re-generate the document after every pagination 
         correction.  In many cases, this will eliminate duplicate effort on 
         subsequent pagination fixes.  Re-generating the document ensures that 
         problems you focus on won't have to be redone.  This is much less of 
         an issue in the RM.)

      c) When you are sure all the pagination is correct (don't forget to 
         start each of the sections included in the Table of Contents on a 
         recto), note page numbers for the beginning of each TOC entry.

6.  Open H5_newUG_TOC.html

      a) Edit page numbers accordingly. 

      b) Save.

7.  Using HTMLdoc:

      a) Open H5_newUG_Front.book

      b) The Input tab:
           Document Type: Web Page
           Input Files:
             H5_newUG_Title.html
             H5_newUG_TOC.html
           Logo Image: none
           Title File/Image: none

      c) The Output tab:
           Output To: File
           Output Path: H5_newUG_Front.pdf
           Output Format: PDF
           Output Options: JPEG Big Images

           JPEG Quality (not critical, change at will): 60
  
      d) The Page tab:
           Page Size: Letter, 2-Sided
             Top: 0.50in, Left: 1.00in, Right: 0.50in, Bottom: 0.50in
           Header: Blank, Blank, Blank
           Footer: Blank, Blank, Blank
           Number Up: 1

      e) The Colors tab:

           Header/Footer Size: 10.0
           Header/Footer Font: Helvetica
           Character Set: iso-8859-1
           Options: Do Not Check 'Embed Fonts'

      g) The PDF tab:
           PDF Version: 1.3
           Page Mode: Document
           Page Layout: Single
           Page Effect: None
           Options: Check 'Include Links'

      h) The Security tab:
           Encryption: No

      i) The Options tab:
           HTML Editor: Point to Dreamweaver (recommended)
           Browser Width: 680
           GUI Options: Check all 3

      j) Save the book file.
     
      k) Verify that the output file (H5_newUG_Front.pdf) is not open.

      l) Generate the document.      


8.  Following a procedure virtually identical to that outlined in (7) above, 
    use the file PDF_CandL.book to generate a 1-page copyright and license 
    statement.

    This page can be generated once and used in both the RM and UG PDFs.  

    Adjust the font size if the copyright and license statement does not 
    initially fit on one page.  To do this, open PDF_C_and_L.book in HTMLdoc; 
    font control is under the "Fonts" tab in the HTMLdoc application window.


9.  Using Adobe Acrobat Pro:

      a) Insert the Copyright page into the frontmatter file and remove any 
         blank pages that prevent the TOC or any subsequent material from 
         appearing on a recto.

         The resulting page order should be as follows:

             Title page            (recto)
             Copyright page        (on the back of the title page)
             TOC                   (starts on a recto; may be several pages)
             additional material   (starts on a recto; may be several pages)

         The resulting file is your final frontmatter file.

      b) Insert the frontmatter file at the front of the previously-generated
         body file.

         Acrobat can be finicky.  
         -- Save the file and quit Acrobat after each "Insert pages" or 
            "Delete pages" operation.  
         -- If you get an error, try doing things in a different order; 
            e.g., if you get an error inserting the body at the end of the
            frontmatter, try inserting the frontmatter to the beginning of 
            the body.

      c) Update the PDF bookmarks.  

         You will be correcting two problems:  First, the default text for 
         many of the automatically-generated bookmarks is inadequate; replace
         them with more descriptive text.  Second, the process of trinmming and
         merging files scrambles the bookmarks pretty badly.

      d) Name the resulting file consistently with the names of UG and RM PDFs 
         from prior releases.


10. Update this 'process.txt' file.


11. Commit the updated 'process.txt' and all of the edits mentioned in step 5
    (see 5c).

        Final UG and RM PDFs 
        Pagination and other changes in the content files
        Updates to the HTMLdoc .book files.
        Any other changes for this process that should be saved for future use
 
    Make sure all commits are merged, as appropriate, to other branches and
    to the repository trunk.
