<h1 align="center">HDF5 User&rsquo;s Guide Update Status</h1>

<br />
<p>The <cite>HDF5 User&rsquo;s Guide</cite> has been updated 
for HDF5 Release 1.8.13. These updates have been made since the 1.8.12 
version of this document was published in November 2013.</p>

<p>The main updates are the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The &ldquo;Properties and Property Lists in HDF5&rdquo; 
        chapter was added. This chapter gives a general overview of 
        how property lists are used by the HDF5 Library.</li>
        <li>The 
        <a href="../Advanced/FreeingMemory/FreeingMemoryAllocatedByTheHdf5Library.pdf">
        <em>Freeing Memory Allocated by the HDF5 Library</em></a> 
        topic was added to the &ldquo;Additional Resources&rdquo; chapter. 
        This topic describes how inconsistent memory management can 
        cause heap corruption or resource leaks and possible solutions.</li>
        <li>The 
        <a href="../Advanced/ModifiedRegionWrites/ModifiedRegionWrites.pdf">
        <em>Modified Region Writes</em></a> topic was added to the 
        &ldquo;Additional Resources&rdquo; chapter. This topic describes 
        how to set write operations for in-memory files so that only 
        modified regions are written to storage. This feature is 
        available when the Core (Memory) VFD is used.</li>
        
    </ul>
