<h3>6.1. Introduction ???????</h3>
</a>
  
  <p>The core strengths of HDF5 are the capacity to handle large amounts
  of complex data and the flexibility to manage that data efficiently. The 
  building blocks that give an HDF5 file its capacity and flexibility are 
  groups and datasets. Datasets will be described in the next chapter. In 
  this chapter, groups will be described, and since links are 
  closely intertwined with groups, links will also be discussed.</p>
  
  <p>Groups and links can be used to arrange data in a meaningful way. 
  For example, objects (groups or datasets) that are used together can 
  be grouped together. Data that comes from similar sources might also be 
  grouped together. </p>
  
  <p>When groups are nested, they create a hierarchy. This 
  hierarchy is similar to the tree structure employed on UNIX file 
  systems using directories and files and on Apple Macintosh and 
  Microsoft Windows systems using folders and files. HDF5 groups are 
  analogous to the directories and folders; HDF5 datasets are analogous 
  to the files.</p>

  <p>The structure of an HDF5 file can also be compared to a geographic 
  map. Cities and towns are like datasets. They come in a wide variety of 
  configurations. Roads are like links that help us get to datasets. 
  Countries, states, and counties are like groups: they help us place 
  the cities and towns where we live and work. </p>

<h3 class=pagebefore>6.2. Defining Groups and Links???????</h3>
</a></a>

  <p>Groups and links provide the way for application programs to navigate 
  to datasets. A <em><b>group</b></em> is a collection of links. 
  A <em><b>link</b></em> is a connection between a group and an object. When we 
  use the term link, we mean a connection between a group and an object 
  that is unidirectional, has a single source, and has a single target. 
  </p>
  
  <p>The purpose of this section is to describe the basic characteristics 
  of groups and links. </p>
  
  
  
  

<a name="Groups">
<h4>6.2.1. Groups???????</h4>
</a>

  <p>A group is a collection of links. If we could peer inside a group, 
  we would see a list of the links that are the members of the group. </p>
  
  <p>Groups do not have names. When we speak of a group, we use the name 
  of the link that is connected to the group. </p>
  
  <p>Groups are used to organize objects. If we were organizing our data 
  by year, we might set up groups for 2010, 2009, and 2008 data. To do this, 
  our file might have three links named 2010, 2009, and 2008 in the root 
  group. The groups that are the targets of these three links might have 
  links to datasets that hold our data.</p>
  
  <p>To work with groups, application programs use the Groups interface. 
  The names of the function calls in this interface start with H5G.</p>
  



  
<a name="TheRootGroup">
<h4>6.2.2. The Root Group???????</h4>
</a>

  <p>When a file is created, a group that we call the root group is 
  created. The root group is the designated starting point for access 
  to objects in the file.</p>
  
  <p>There is no name for this group just as there is no name 
  applied to any object. When we write about the root group, when we 
  need to specify the root group in a parameter, we use a 
  slash, <code>/</code>. </p>
  
  <p>Every group is created with a hard link. The link that is created 
  with the root group is slightly different from other links in that it 
  does not have a name and cannot be changed. This means the root group
  cannot be moved or deleted. See the <a href="#HardAndSymbolicLinks"> 
  &ldquo;Hard and Symbolic Links&rdquo;</a> section for more information.</p>
  

  
  
  
  
<a name="LinkPaths">
<h4>6.2.3. Link Paths???????</h4>
</a>

  <p>A link is a connection or association between a group and an object. 
  A group is the source of the link, and the object is the target of the 
  link. </p>

  <p>Every link has a name, and no object has a name. When 
  we talk about an object, we might call the object by the link's name. 
  Suppose a group has a link named Y1, and the target of Y1 is a 
  dataset. If we refer to the dataset as Y1, what we really mean is 
  the dataset that is the target of the link called Y1. See the figure 
  below. </p>
  
  <p>As more data is added to our file, we can nest datasets within 
  groups and groups within groups. As we add links to groups, we need 
  to remember that link names need to be unique within each group. </p>
  
  <p>To navigate to a group or dataset, we combine the links to the group 
  or dataset into a <em><b>link path</b></em>. Link names can be used in 
  more than one place as long as the link paths are unique.</p>
  
  <p>A link path can be absolute or relative. An absolute 
  link path starts at the root group. A relative link path starts 
  from some other known position such as the current working group. </p>
  
  <p>A link path looks like a path name in a file system tree structure. 
  Each link name is separated from another link name by a slash, 
  <code>/</code>. The link name following a slash is always a member of 
  the object that is the target of the link name preceding that slash. 
  For example, in the link path <code>/GroupA/GroupB/Dataset1</code>, 
  the link <code>GroupB</code> is a member of the group that is the target 
  of the link <code>GroupA</code>.</p>

  <p>The first component in a link path may be any of the 
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The special character dot (., a period), the current group</li>
    <li>The special character slash (/), the root group</li>
    <li>The name of a link that is a member of the current group</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Link names may be any string of ASCII or UTF-8 characters that do 
  not contain a slash or a dot. These are reserved as noted above. 
  However, users are advised to avoid the use of punctuation and 
  non-printing characters in link names: these may create problems for 
  other software. </p>

  <p>In an <em><b>absolute link path</b></em> for an object, we start with 
  a slash as the root group, and then we add other link names 
  separated by slashes to get to the object. An example might be 
  <code>/GroupA/GroupB/Dataset1</code>. What we are really saying 
  when we write <code>/GroupA/GroupB/Dataset1</code> is the following: 
  to get to the dataset that is the target of the <code>Dataset1</code> link, 
  start at the root group, look for the link called <code>GroupA</code>, and 
  follow it. The <code>GroupA</code> link is a member of the root group. 
  Next, look for the link called <code>GroupB</code>, and follow it. 
  <code>GroupB</code> is a member of the group that is the target of 
  the link called <code>GroupA</code>. Finally, find the link called 
  <code>Dataset1</code> in the group that is the target of the link called 
  <code>GroupB</code>, and follow it. </p>
  
  <p>A <em><b>relative link path</b></em> starts from some group other 
  than the root group. If the current working location in the file shown 
  in the figure below is the group that is the target of the link 
  <code>YB</code>, then the dataset that is the target of the 
  <code>Y3</code> link can be identified by the relative link path 
  <code>YC/Y3</code>.</p>

  <p>There may be multiple link paths to an object. In the figure below, 
  the dataset that is the target of the absolute link path 
  <code>/YA/Y1</code> is the same dataset that is the target of the 
  absolute link path <code>/YA/YB/YC/Y3</code>. </p>
  
  <p>The dataset that is the target of the <code>Y1</code> and 
  <code>Y3</code> links might be accessed using different relative link 
  paths from the <code>YB</code> group (the group that is the target of 
  the <code>YB</code> link). Possible relative link paths are 
  <code>YC/Y3</code> and <code>YC/YD/Y1</code>.</p>

          by rectangles. 
       </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that relative link paths in HDF5 do not employ the 
  <code>../ </code> notation. The <code>../ </code> notation is used
  in UNIX to indicate a parent directory and is not used in HDF5 to indicate
  a parent group.</p>

  <p>Another feature to note in the figure above is what the link 
  <code>YD</code> represents. Since the underlying structure of an HDF5 
  file is a directed graph, circular references such as <code>YD</code> 
  are possible. If the structure of an HDF5 file kept to a strict tree 
  structure like that used in file systems, then circular references 
  would not be possible. In the figure above, the dataset specified 
  by the <code>/YA/Y1</code> link path could also be specified with 
  the following link path: <code>/YA/YB/YC/YD/Y1</code>. Another 
  example is the ZBB link in the <a href="#ExamplesOfGroupsAndLinks">
  &ldquo;Examples of Groups and Links&rdquo;</a> section below. </p>

  
<a name="HardAndSymbolicLinks">
<h4>6.2.4. Hard and Symbolic Links???????</h4>
</a>
  <p>There are two types of links: hard and symbolic. Hard links are 
  constructed with a physical address, and symbolic links are constructed 
  with names. Characteristics of hard and symbolic links are listed below.</p>

  <p>Characteristics of a hard link:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A hard link is made with a physical address in the file</li>
    <li>A hard link occurs within a single file</li>
    <li>When a group or dataset is created, a hard link is also
        created </li>
    <li>At least one hard link exists for every group or dataset </li>
    <li>A hard link and the group or dataset that is the target of the link 
        exist together (hard links cannot dangle) </li>
    <li>A hard link is created using <code>H5Lcreate_hard</code></li>
    <li>A group or dataset may be the target of more than one hard link </li>
    <li>If a group or dataset is not the target of at least one hard link, 
        then the group or dataset cannot be accessed, and the space occupied 
        by the group or dataset will be reclaimed the next time the 
        <code>h5repack</code> tool is run</li>
    <li>The target of a hard link will increase its reference count by one 
        when the hard link is created, and the reference count will decline 
        by one when the hard link is deleted</li>
</ul>

  <p>Characteristics of a symbolic link:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A symbolic link uses a name rather than a physical address</li>
    <li>The target of a symbolic link can be changed</li>
    <li>There are two types of symbolic links: soft and external</li>
    <li>The target of a soft symbolic link (a soft link) will be a group 
        or dataset within a file</li>
    <li>The target of an external symbolic link (an external link) will be 
        a group or dataset in another file</li>
    <li>A symbolic link can exist with or without its target object
        (symbolic links can dangle) </li>
        <ul>
        <li>Suppose a symbolic link is created. The target object may or 
        may not exist when the symbolic link is created. When an application 
        opens the target object via the symbolic link, then either the 
        target will be opened, or an error message will be generated.</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
    <li>A symbolic link can be created with <code>H5Lcreate_soft</code> or 
        <code>H5Lcreate_external</code>
    <li>A group or dataset may be the target of more than one symbolic 
        link</li>
    <li>The target of a symbolic link will not change its reference count 
        when the symbolic link is created or deleted</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For more information, see the 
  <a href="#ReferenceCount">&ldquo;Reference Count&rdquo;</a> and 
  <a href="#ProgModelCreatingHardLinks">&ldquo;Creating Hard Links&rdquo;</a> 
  sections below.</p>
  
  <p>User-defined links might be hard or symbolic, or they might be some 
  kind of combination. See the <code>H5Lcreate_ud</code> function call in 
  the <a href="../RM/RM_H5Front.html" target="RMwindow"><cite>HDF5 Reference 
  Manual</cite></a>.</p>
  
  
  
<a name="ExamplesOfGroupsAndLinks">
<h4>6.2.5. Examples of Groups and Links???????</h4>
</a>
  <p>The figures below illustrate the range of possibilities for groups 
  and links. In the figures, circles are used to represent groups, 
  rectangles are used for datasets, and arrows are used for links.</p>

  <p>In the figure below, the group structure is hierarchical in the same 
  way a file system operates.</p>
  
<table align="center" width="500" border="0">

<br />

  <p>In the figure below, the structure takes advantage of the directed 
  graph&rsquo;s allowance of circular references and illustrates 
  an extreme case in which a group via link ZBB is a member of itself. 
  A possible reference to a member dataset such as 
  <code>/ZA/ZB/ZBB/Z2</code> could be set up. Directed graph structures 
  can become quite complex.</p>

  <p>When a new object is created, the HDF5 Library executes the 
  link operation in the background immediately after creating the object. 
  In other words, the creation operation creates the object and creates
  the hard link that connects the object to a group.</p>
    
  <a name="ProgModelCreateGroup"> 
<h4>6.3.1. Creating a Group???????</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>To create a group, use the <code>H5Gcreate</code> macro. 
  When used, <code>H5Gcreate</code> creates a group, opens the group 
  (returns an identifier that can be used in other operations), and 
  creates a hard link. </p>
  
  <p>To create a simple group, specify values for the <code>loc_id</code> 
  and <code>name</code> parameters and use the default property list 
  parameter value (<code>H5P_DEFAULT</code>) for the property list 
  parameters. The <code>loc_id</code> parameter is used to specify the 
  location identifier. The location identifier is the object 
  identifier for the file or group where the new group will be connected. 
  The value of the <code>name</code> parameter will be a link or link path. 
  If the value of <code>loc_id</code> is a file identifier, then the 
  value of the <code>name</code> parameter will be an absolute link path. 
  If the value of <code>loc_id</code> is a group identifier, then the 
  value of the <code>name</code> parameter should be a relative link path 
  from the group specified with the <code>loc_id</code> parameter. 
  See <a href="#LinkPaths">&ldquo;Link Paths&rdquo;</a> and 
  <a href="#IdentifiersAndLinkPaths">&ldquo;Identifiers and Link 
  Paths&rdquo;</a> for more information.  </p>
  
  <p>The code in the example below creates three groups. </p>
  
  <p>The first group that is created is the target of the 
  <code>Data</code> link. The <code>Data</code> link 
  is a member of the root group, and the location identifier 
  <code>file_id</code> is the object identifier for the file. The 
  identifier for the file was returned to the application as a result of 
  the file being opened in the second line of the example.</p>
  
  <p>Two other groups are then created and linked to the group that is 
  the target of the <code>Data</code> link. The first group uses the 
  file identifier <code>file_id</code> and an absolute link path 
  for the name of the link. The second group uses the group 
  identifier <code>group_id</code> and a relative link path for the name 
  of the link. The identifier <code>group_id</code> was returned when 
  the group that is the target of the <code>Data</code> link was 
  created.</p>

<h4>6.3.2. Opening a Group???????</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>It is often useful to explicitly open a group when working with 
  objects that are the targets of links that are members of that group. 
  To open a group, use the <code>H5Gopen</code> macro. </p>
  
  <p>The example below refers to the groups in Figure 5 above and 
  illustrates different ways to open groups. Opening a dataset is a similar 
  process. </p>
  
  <p>To open an object using a relative link path, an application 
  must first open the group or file on which the relative link path is 
  based. In the first line of the example below, a previously-acquired 
  file identifier, <code>file_id</code>, is used to open the group 
  that is the target of the <code>/Data</code> link path, and then 
  the returned group identifier, <code>group_id</code>, and a relative 
  link path, <code>Data_new1</code>, are used to open the group that is the 
  target of the <code>Data_new1</code> link.</p>
  
  <p>To open an object using an absolute link path, the application 
  can use the file identifier, <code>file_id</code>, and an absolute link 
  path. In the third line of the example below, <code>file_id</code> is used 
  with <code>/Data/Data_new2</code> to open the group that is the target of 
  the <code>Data_new2</code> link.</p>

<h4>6.3.3. Creating a Dataset???????</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>The process of creating a dataset is like the process of creating 
  a group that was discussed above. When a dataset is created, a hard 
  link to it is automatically created. The link will be a member of a 
  group, and when we talk about the dataset, we will use the name of 
  the link to refer to the dataset. As with groups, a dataset may be 
  created in a group by specifying an absolute link path or a relative 
  link path. The example below illustrates both approaches to creating 
  a dataset in the group that is the target of the <code>/Data</code> 
  link. The absolute link path to the first dataset is 
  <code>/Data/CData</code>. The <code>H5Dcreate</code> macro uses a 
  previously-acquired <code>file_id</code> and the default property list 
  parameter <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code>. For the second dataset, the example 
  first opens the group which will be the source of the link to the 
  dataset, and then uses the <code>group_id</code> and the relative link 
  <code>Cdata2</code> to create and locate the dataset.</p>

<h4>6.3.4. Closing a Group???????</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>To ensure the integrity of HDF5 objects and to release system 
  resources, an application should always call the appropriate 
  close function when it is through working with an HDF5 object. 
  In the case of groups, <code>H5Gclose</code> ends access to the group 
  and releases any resources the HDF5 Library has maintained 
  in support of that access including the group identifier.  </p>
  
  <p>As illustrated in the example below, all that is required for an 
  <code>H5Gclose</code> call is the group identifier acquired when 
  the group was opened. There are no relative versus absolute link path 
  considerations.</p>

  <a name="ProgModelCreatingHardLinks">
<h4>6.3.5. Creating Hard Links ???????</h4>
  </a>

  <p>When a group or a dataset is created, a hard link is also created. 
  This hard link gives the group or dataset a location in the file. 
  After a group or dataset is created, additional hard links can be 
  explicitly added by means of the <code>H5Lcreate_hard</code> function 
  call to improve access and resource efficiency. See the 
  <a href="#DefiningGroupsAndLinks"> &ldquo;Defining Groups and 
  Links&rdquo;</a> section for more information.</p>

  <p>The code in the example below illustrates the creation of a hard link 
  named <code>Y3</code>. 
  Once that link is created, the dataset that is the target of the 
  absolute link path <code>/YA/Y1</code> can also be accessed by means 
  of the absolute link path <code>/YA/YB/YC/Y3</code>. </p>
  
  <p>Here are some comments for each line in the example below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The file is opened. The identifier <code>file_id</code> is 
      returned.</li>
    <li>The group that is the target of the <code>/YA/YB/YC</code> link
      is opened and returns the <code>group_id</code> identifier.</li>
    <li>The <code>Y3</code> link is created. The <code>file_id</code> 
      identifier and the absolute link path <code>/YA/Y1</code> are 
      used to specify the dataset that will be the target of the new

    <p>When the last hard link to an object is deleted, the object is no

    then deletes the last hard link to the dataset. While
    the dataset is open, your application still has a connection to the 
    dataset through the identifier returned when the dataset was opened.

  <a name="CreatingSymbolicLinks">
<h4>6.3.7. Creating Symbolic Links???????</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>Symbolic links are based on names and not on physical file addresses. 
  Symbolic links are similar to the soft links, aliases, and shortcuts 
  that are used with various operating systems. Programmers can use 
  symbolic links to more easily work with any long link paths they may 
  be using and to work with objects in other HDF5 files. There are two
  kinds of symbolic links: soft and external. Soft links are 
  used within a single file. External links are used to connect files.</p>
  
  <p>A big difference between symbolic links and hard links is the status 
  of the target when the link is created. The target of a hard link must 
  exist when the hard link is created. The target of a symbolic link may 
  or may not exist when the link is created. If a symbolic link is created 
  and the target does not exist, the link is said to dangle or to be a 
  dangling link. So, symbolic links are more flexible than hard links.</p>

  <p><b>To create a soft link</b>, use the <code>H5Lcreate_soft</code> 
  function call. The function call has five parameters. The last two are 
  property lists. In the example below, the default property list value 
  <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code> is used. The first three parameters are 
  called in the <cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite> <code>target_path</code>, 
  <code>link_loc_id</code>, and <code>link_name</code>. </p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>target_path</code> is a link path to the target of 
  the soft link. This is not the soft link. This is what the soft link 
  resolves to when the soft link is used. The links in this link path 
  may or may not exist when the soft link is created, but the links and 
  any intermediate groups in this link path must exist when the soft link 
  is first used in order for the soft link to work. </p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>link_loc_id</code> is a file identifier or a 
  group identifier. If the value of this parameter is a file identifier, 
  then the values of the <code>target_path</code> and 
  <code>link_name</code> parameters should be absolute link paths. If 
  the value of this parameter is a group identifier, then the values of 
  the <code>target_path</code> and <code>link_name</code> parameters 
  could be either relative or absolute link paths. A relative link 
  path would start from the group identifier's group. </p>
  
  <p>The value of <code>link_name</code> is the name of the new soft 
  link. In the example below, the new soft link is called 
  <code>2010</code>.</p>
  
  <p>The example below creates a soft link called <code>2010</code> 
  with a <code>link_loc_id</code> of <code>file_id</code> and a 
  <code>target_path</code> of <code>/YA/YB/YC/Y3</code>. The example 
  then opens the dataset that is the target of the soft link.</p>

  <p>There is often a need to retrieve information about a particular object.
  The <code>H5Lget_info</code> and <code>H5Oget_info</code> functions fill

  The <code>H5Literate</code> function is useful both with a single group and 
  in an iterative process that examines an entire file 
  or section of a file (such as the contents of a group or the contents 
  of all the groups that are members of that group)
  and acts on objects as they are encountered. The <code>H5Ovisit</code>

  <p>The <code>h5dump</code> application program is a command-line 
  utility that is distributed with HDF5. It can be used to inspect 
  the contents of an HDF5 file. It can show the structure of a file 
  so that you can determine where to create an object or so that you

  <p>The figure above illustrates loops in an HDF5 group structure. 
  The file in Figure 9a contains three groups and a dataset. 
  The group that is the target of the <code>group2</code> link is a 
  member of the root group and is also a member of the group that is the 
  target of the <code>group1</code> link. The group that is the target 
  of the <code>group2</code> link can be accessed by either of two link 
  paths: <code>/group2</code> or <code>/group1/GXX</code>. 
  Similarly, the dataset can be accessed by these link paths: 
  <code>/group2/dset1</code> or <code>/group1/GXX/dset1</code>.</p>

  <p>Figure 9b illustrates a different case: the dataset is the target 
  of two links that are both members of the same group. In this case, 
  the dataset again has two names: <code>/group1/dset1</code> and 
  <code>/group1/dset2</code>.</p>
  
  
<!-- NEW PAGE -->
  <p>In Figure 9c, the dataset that is the target of the <code>dset1</code> 
  link is a member of two groups. The dataset has three absolute link 
  paths: <code>/group1/dset1</code>, <code>/group2/dset2</code>, and 
  <code>/group1/GXX/dset2</code>. </p>
  
  <p>In Figure 9d, two of the groups are members of each other, and the 
  dataset is a member of both groups. In this case, there are an infinite 
  number of paths to the dataset because <code>GXX</code> and 
  <code>GYY</code> can be traversed any number of times on the way from 
  the root group, <code>/</code>, to the dataset. This can yield a link path 
  such as <code>/group1/GXX/GYY/GXX/GYY/GXX/dset2</code>.</p>

  <p>
  The figure above takes us into the realm of soft links.
  The original file, in Figure 10a, contains only three hard links.
  In Figure 10b, a soft link named <code>dset2</code> has been created.
  The source of the new link is the group that is the target of the 
  <code>group2</code> link. The target of the new link is also the target 
  of the <code>/group1/dset1</code> link path.</p>
  
  <p>In Figure 10c, another soft link, <code>dset3</code>, has been created 
  in the group that is the target of the <code>group2</code> link. The 
  target <code>dset3</code> does not yet exist. That target object has 
  been added in Figure 10d along with the hard link <code>dset</code>. The 
  target dataset is now accessible as either <code>/group2/dset</code> or
  <code>/group2/dset3</code>.</p>

<h4>6.6.3. Identifiers and Link Paths???????</h4>
  </a>
  
  <p>Identifiers are generated and returned to an application when a 
  group or file is created or opened. Identifiers are then used in the 
  <code>loc_id</code> parameter along with link paths in the 
  <code>name</code> parameter of function calls to create or open other 
  groups and links. Link paths can be either absolute or relative. The 
  purpose of this section is to describe the possible kinds of identifiers 
  and the appropriate link path type for each kind of identifier.  </p>
  
  <p><b>File identifier and absolute link path.</b> When a file is created 
  or opened by an application, a file identifier is returned. When the 
  file identifier is used in a function call, the name parameter should 
  specify an absolute link path. With the file identifier and an absolute 
  link path, the function call will be able to identify the file to work 
  on and the location of the object from the root group. To operate on 
  the root group, use a file identifier and a slash, <code>/</code>. </p>
  
  <p><b>Group identifer and relative link path.</b> When a group is created 
  or opened, a group identifier is returned. When the group identifier is 
  used in a function call, the <code>name</code> parameter can specify 
  either a relative link path or an absolute link path. With the group 
  identifier and a relative link path, the function call will be able 
  to identify the group and the location of the object from the group. 
  With the group identifier and an absolute link path, the function 
  call will be able to identify the file to work on and the location 
  of the object from the root group.</p>

  <p><b>Any identifier and absolute link path.</b> With any identifier 
  and an absolute link path, a function call can create or open a group 
  or link that is not connected to the identifier. The function call 
  uses the identifier to specify the file to work in and uses the 
  absolute link path to specify the link to the created or opened 
  group or dataset from the root group.</p>
  
  
<table align="center" width="500" class="greenframe2">
  <tr ><td>
      <p><b>Programming reminder</b></p>
      
      <p>An application should track every identifier that has been 
      returned to it. When the application is finished using the resource 
      that is associated with the identifier, the identifier should be 
      released by closing the resource. For example, use 
      <code>H5Gclose</code> to close a group, or use <code>H5Oclose</code> 
      to close an object. See <a href="#ClosingAGroup">&ldquo;Closing a 
      Group&rdquo;</a> for more information. </p>
