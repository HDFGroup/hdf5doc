<h1>Using This Guide with HDF5 Release 1.8.x</h1>


Several sections describing new features introduced with HDF5 Release 1.8.x
have been added to this <cite>HDF5 User's Guide</cite>:
<ul>
    <li>N-bit and scale/offset filters, in the chapter
        &ldquo;<a href="10_Datasets.html">HDF5 Datasets</a>&rdquo;
    <li>New Error API functions, H5E, in the chapter
        &ldquo;<a href="13_ErrorHandling.html">HDF5 Error Handling</a>&rdquo;
    <li>Metadata caching, in the chapter
        &ldquo;<a href="17_SpecialTopics.html">Special Topics</a>&rdquo;
</ul>

<p>
Other work to bring the <cite>Guide</cite> up to date with 
the HDF5 Release 1.8.x series remains to be done.
Readers should keep the following things in mind:
<ul>
    <li>Principles and models described in the <cite>Guide</cite> 
        remain applicable to the 1.8.x series.
    <li>The function summaries in several chapters are incomplete for
        the 1.8.x series.  Refer to the 
        <a href="../RM/RM_H5Front.html"><cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite></a>
        for complete lists.
    <li>Code examples use function syntax from the 1.6.x release series.
        See the note below regarding the use of 1.6.x syntax with a
        1.8.x version of the HDF5 Library.
</ul>

<h3>Using 1.6.x syntax with the 1.8.x library</h3>

HDF5 Release 1.8.x includes an API compatibility feature that enables 
codes written with 1.6.x function syntax to be compiled against and 
linked with an HDF5 Release 1.8.x Library.

<p>
When working with an installed version of the HDF5 Library that has 
been built with default settings, use the
<a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-H5CC"><code>h5cc</code></a> 
script and the <code>-DH5_USE_16_API</code> flag
to compile and link your C program as follows:
<pre>
    h5cc &lt;<i>other_instructions</i>&gt; -DH5_USE_16_API . . .
</pre>
A comparable script,
<a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-H5FC"><code>h5fc</code></a>, 
is provided for Fortran programs.
<!-- FOR USE WITH PRINT VERSION ----------------------------------------
<code>h5cc</code> and <code>h5fc</code> are described 
in the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; section 
of the <cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite>.
<!-- FOR USE WITH PRINT VERSION ---------------------------------------->

in HDF5</a>.&rdquo;
