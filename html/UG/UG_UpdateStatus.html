<h1 align="center">HDF5 User&rsquo;s Guide Update Status</h1>

<br />
<p>The <cite>HDF5 User&rsquo;s Guide</cite> has been updated 
for HDF5 Release 1.8.11. These updates have been made since the 1.8.10 
version of this document was published in November 2012.</p>

<p>The main updates are the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The direct chunk write API was added. See the 
        &ldquo;Using the Direct Chunk Write Function&rdquo; topic in the 
        &ldquo;Additional Resources&rdquo; chapter. </li>
        <li>The H5Dgather/scatter functions were added to the function 
        listing in the &ldquo;Dataset Function Listings&rdquo; section 
        in the &ldquo;HDF5 Datasets&rdquo; chapter. </li>
        <li>The <code>H5Pget/set_dxpl_multi</code> functions were 
        removed from the &ldquo;HDF5 Datasets&rdquo; chapter. 
        The intended functionality for the functions was never fully 
        implemented, and the functions have always been fundamentally 
        broken. Removing these functions does not affect setting the 
        Multi virutal file driver (VFD) or any expected VFD functionality. 
        Multi VFD usage remains unchanged.  </li>
        <li>An additional explanation for converting enumerations was 
        added to the &ldquo;Data Transfer: Datatype Conversion and 
        Selection&rdquo; section in the 
        &ldquo;HDF5 Datatypes&rdquo; chapter.</li>
    </ul>

<p>We welcome feedback on the documentation. Please send your comments to
