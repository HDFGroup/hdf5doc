<h4>1.1. Introduction and Definitions</h4>
  
  <p>The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) implements a model for managing and storing data. 
  The model includes an abstract data model and an abstract storage model (the data format), 
  and libraries to implement the abstract model and to map the storage model to different 
  storage mechanisms. The HDF5 library provides a programming interface to a concrete 
  implementation of the abstract models. The library also implements a model of data 
  transfer, i.e., efficient movement of data from one stored representation to another 
  stored representation. Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between the models and 
  implementations. This chapter explains these models in detail.</p>

  <p>The <em>Abstract Data Model</em> is a conceptual model of data, data types, 
  and data organization. The Abstract Data Model is independent of storage medium 
  or programming environment. 
  The <em>Storage Model</em> is a standard representation 
  for the objects of the <em>Abstract Data Model</em>. 
  The <a href="../H5.format.html" target="H5DocWin"><cite>HDF5 File Format Specification</cite></a> 
  defines the <em>Storage Model</em>.
   
  <p>The <em>Programming Model</em> is a model of the computing environment, 
  which includes many platforms, from small single systems to large multiprocessors 
  and clusters. The <em>Programming Model</em> manipulates (instantiates, populates, 
  and retrieves) objects from the <em>Abstract Data Model</em>.
  
  <p>The <em>Library</em> is the concrete implementation of the <em>Programming 
  Model</em>. The <em>Library</em> exports the HDF5 APIs as its interface. 
  In addition to implementing the objects of the <em>Abstract Data Model</em>, 
  the <em>Library</em> manages data transfers from one stored form to another 
  (e.g., read from disk to memory, write from memory to disk, etc.). 
  
  <p>The <em>Stored Data</em> is the concrete implementation of the <em>Storage 
  Model</em>. The <em>Storage Model</em> is mapped to several storage mechanisms, 
  including single disk files, multiple files (family of files), 
  and memory representations.
  
  <p>The HDF5 Library is a C module that implements the <em>Programming Model</em> 
  and <em>Abstract Data Model</em>. The HDF5 Library calls the Operating System 
  or other Storage Management software (e.g., the MPI/IO Library) to store and 
  retrieve persistent data. The HDF5 Library may also link to other software, 
  such as filters for compression. The HDF5 Library is linked to an application 
  program, which may be written in C, C++, Fortran 90, or Java. The application 
  program implements problem specific algorithms and data structures, and calls 
  the HDF5 Library to store and retrieve data. Figure 2 shows the dependencies of 
  these modules.</p>

  <p>It is important to realize that each of the software components manages data 
  using models and data structures that are appropriate to the component. When data 
  is passed between layers-during storage or retrieval-it is transformed from one 
  representation to another. Figure 3 suggests some of the kinds of data structures 
  used in the different layers.
  
  <p>The <em>Application Program</em> uses data structures that represent the problem 
  and algorithms, including variables, tables, arrays, and meshes, among other data 
  structures. Obviously, an application might have quite a few different kinds of 
  data structures, and different numbers and sizes of objects, depending on its 
  design and function.
  
  <p>The HDF5 <em>Library</em> implements the objects of the HDF5 <em>Abstract 
  Data Model</em>. These include Groups, Datasets, and Attributes and other objects 
  as defined in this Chapter. The Application Program maps the application data 
  structures to a hierarchy of HDF5 objects. Each application will create a mapping 
  best suited to its purposes.

  <p>The objects of the HDF5 <em>Abstract Data Model</em> are mapped to the objects 
  of the HDF5 <em>Storage Model</em>, and stored in a storage medium. 
<!-- editingComment
  (Section ?? below) 
-->
  The stored objects include header blocks, free lists, data blocks, 
  B-trees, and other objects. Each Group, Dataset, etc. is stored as one or 
  more header and data blocks, organized as defined in the
  <a href="../H5.format.html" target="H5DocWin"><cite>HDF5 File Format Specification</cite></a>. 
  The HDF5 <em>Library</em> can also use other 
  libraries and modules, such as compression.</p>

  <p>The important point to note is that there is not necessarily any simple 
  correspondence between the  objects of the <em>Application Program</em>, 
  the <em>Abstract Data Model</em>, and those of the <em>Format Specification</em>. 
  The organization of the data of <em>Application Program</em>, and how it is mapped 
  to the HDF5 <em>Abstract Data Model</em> is up to the application developer. 
  The Application Program only needs to deal with the <em>Library</em> and the 
  <em>Abstract Data Model</em>. Most applications need not consider any details of 
  the <a href="../H5.format.html" target="H5DocWin"><cite>HDF5 File Format Specification</cite></a>, 
  or the details of how objects of <em>Abstract Data Model</em> 
  are translated to and from storage.</p>

<h4>2.1. Purpose and Summary of the Abstract Data Model</h4>

  <p>The <em>Abstract Data Model</em> (ADM) defines concepts for defining and 
  describing complex data stored in files. The HDF5 ADM is a very general model 
  which is designed to conceptually cover many specific models of data. Many different 
  kinds of data can be mapped to objects of the HDF5 ADM, and therefore stored and 
  retrieved using HDF5. The ADM is not, however, a model of any particular problem or 
  application domain. Users need to map their data to the concepts of the ADM.
  
  <p>The key concepts include:
  
  <ul>
      <li><em>File</em> - a contiguous string of bytes in a computer 
          store (memory, disk, etc.). 
	  The bytes represent zero or more objects of the model.
      <li><em>Group</em> - a collection of objects (including groups).
      <li><em>Dataset</em> - a multidimensional array of Data Elements, 
          with Attributes and other metadata. 
      <li><em>Datatype</em> - a description of a specific class of data 
          element, including its storage layout as a pattern of bits.
      <li><em>Dataspace</em> - a description of the dimensions of a 
          multidimensional array.
      <li><em>Attribute</em> - a named data value associated with a group, 
          dataset, or named datatype
      <li><em>Property List</em> - a collection of parameters controlling 
          options in the library. Some properties are permanently stored 
	  as part of the object; others are transient and apply to a specific 
	  access. Each class of property list has specific properties.
  </ul>

<h4>2.2. Definitions</h4>

<h4><em>File</em></h4>

  <p>Abstractly, an HDF5 File is a container for an organized collection of objects. 
  The objects are Groups and Datasets and other objects as defined below. 
  The objects are organized as a rooted,  directed graph.  Every HDF5 file has at 
  least one object, the root group (Figure 4). All objects are members of the 
  root group or descendents of the root group.</p>

  <p>HDF5 objects have a unique identity <em>within a single HDF5 file</em>, and 
  can be accessed only by its names within the hierarchy of the file. HDF5 objects 
  in different files do not necessarily have unique identities, and it is not possible 
  to access a permanent HDF5 object except through a file. 
  See the section "<a href="#Structure">The Structure of an HDF5 File</a>" 
  below for an explanation of the structure of the HDF5 file.
  
  <p>When the file is created, the <em>File Creation Properties</em> specify 
  settings for the file. File Creation Properties include version information 
  and parameters of global data structures. When the file is opened, 
  the <em>File Access Properties</em> specify settings for the current access to 
  the file. File Access Properties include parameters for storage drivers 
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">(see section ??  below)</span>
-->
  and parameters for caching and garbage collection. 
  The <em>File Creation Properties</em> are permanent for the life of the file, 
  the <em>File Access Properties</em> can be changed by closing and reopening 
  the file. 
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">
  See PPP for more information about Property Lists and properties. 
  </span>
-->
  
  <p>An HDF5 file can be "mounted" as part of another HDF5 file. This is analogous 
  to Unix File System mounts. The root of the mounted file is attached to a Group 
  in the mounting file, and all the contents can be accessed as if the mounted file 
  were part of the mounting file.   
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">
  See XXX for an explanation of mounted files.
  </span>
-->

<h4><em>Group</em></h4>
  
  <p>An HDF5 <em>Group</em> is analogous to a file system directory. Abstractly, 
  a Group contains zero or more objects, and every object must be a member of at 
  least one Group. (The root Group is a special case; it may not be a member of any group.)
  
  <p>Group membership is actually implemented via <em>Link</em> objects (Figure 5).
  A Link object is owned by a Group and points to a <em>Named Object</em>. Each 
  Link has a <em>name</em>, and each link points to exactly one object. Each Named 
  Object has at least one and possibly many Links to it.

  <p>There are three classes of Named Objects: <em>Group</em>, <em>Dataset</em>,

  at least one Group, which means there is at least one <em>Link</em> to it.</p>

  <p>An HDF5 <em>Dataset</em> is a multidimensional (rectangular) array of <em>Data 
  Elements</em> (Figure 7). The shape of the array (number of dimensions, size of 
  each dimension) is described by the <em>Dataspace</em> object (see below).
  
  <p>A Data Element is a single unit of data which may be a number, a character, 
  an array of numbers or characters, or a record of heterogeneous data elements.  
  A Data Element is a set of bits, the layout of the bits is described by the 
  <em>Datatype</em> (see below).
  
  <p>The <em>Dataspace</em> and <em>Datatype</em> are set when the <em>Dataset</em> 
  is created, they can not be changed for the life of the Dataset. The <em>Dataset 
  Creation Properties</em> are set when the Dataset is created. The Dataset Creation 
  Properties include the fill value and storage properties such as chunking and 
  compression.  These properties cannot be changed after the Dataset is created.
  
  <p>The Dataset object manages the storage and access to the Data. While the Data 
  is conceptually a contiguous rectangular array, it is physically stored and 
  transferred in different ways depending on the storage properties and the storage 
  mechanism used. The actual storage may be a set of chunks, which may be compressed, 
  and the access may be through different storage mechanisms and caches. The Dataset 
  maps between the conceptual array of elements and the actual stored data.</p>

<h4><em>Dataspace</em></h4>
  
  <p>The HDF5 <em>Dataspace</em> describes the layout of the elements of a multidimensional 
  array. Conceptually, the array is a hyper-rectangle with one to 32 dimensions. 
  HDF5 Dataspaces can be extendable. Therefore, each dimension has a current and 
  maximum size, and the maximum may be unlimited. The <em>Dataspace</em> describes 
  this hyper-rectangle: it is a list of dimensions, with the current and maximum 
  (or unlimited) size (Figure 8).</p>

<br>

  <p>Dataspace objects are also used to describe hyperslab selections from a dataset. 
  Any subset of the elements of a Dastaset can be selected for <em>read</em> or 
  <em>write</em> by specifying a set of hyperslabs. A non-rectangular region can 
  be selected by the union of several (rectangular) Dataspaces.  
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">
  See SSS for more 
  information about data selection and hyperslabs.
  </span>
-->

<h4><em>Datatype</em></h4>
  
  <p>The HDF5 <em>Datatype</em> object describes the layout of a single data element. 
  A data element is a single element of the array; it may be a single number, 
  a character, an array of numbers or carriers, or other data. The Datatype 
  object describes the storage layout of this data. 

  <p>Data types are categorized into 11 classes of Datatype. Each class is 
  interpreted according to a set of rules and has a specific set of properties 
  to describe its storage. For instance, floating point numbers have exponent 
  position and sizes, which are interpreted according to appropriate standards 
  for number representation. Thus, the Datatype Class tells what the element means, 
  and the Datatype describes how it is stored.
  
<!-- NEW PAGE -->
  <p>Figure 9 shows the classification of data types. Atomic Datatypes are 
  indivisible, each may be a single object; a number, a string, or some other 
  objects. The Composite Datatypes are composed of multiple elements of atomic 
  Datatypes. In addition to the standard types, users can define additional 
  Datatypes, such as a 24-bit integer, or a 16-bit float.
  
  <p>A Dataset or Attribute has a single Datatype object associated with 
  it (Figure 7). The Datatype object may be used in the definition of several objects, 
  but by default, a copy of the Datatype object will be private to the Dataset. 

  <p>Optionally, a Datatype object can be stored in the HDF5 file. The Datatype is 
  linked into a Group, and therefore given a name. A <em>Named Datatype</em> can be 
  opened and used in any way that a Datatype object can be used.
  
  <p>The details of Datatypes, their properties, and how they are used are 
  explained in the datatypes chapter, 
  "<a href="11_Datatypes.html">HDF5 Datatypes</a>."</p>

<h4><em>Attribute</em></h4>
  
  <p>Any HDF5 Named Data Object (Group, Dataset, or Named Datatype) may have zero or 
  more user defined <em>Attributes</em>. Attributes are used to document the object. 
  The Attributes of an object are stored with the object.
  
  An HDF5 Attribute has a <em>name</em> and data. The data is described 
  analogously to the Dataset: the Dataspace defines the layout of an array of 
  Data Elements, and the Datatype defines the storage layout and interpretation 
  of the elements (Figure 10).</p>

  </tr>
</table>
  
  <p>In fact, a Attribute is very similar to a Dataset with 
  the following limitations:
  
  <ul>
      <li>An attribute can only be accessed via the object, attribute names are 
          significant only within the object. Attributes cannot be shared.
      <li>For practical reasons, an Attribute should be a small object, no more 
          than 1000 bytes.
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">[ [ [ Correct? ] ] ]
  </span>
-->
      <li>The data of an Attribute must be read or written in a single access, 
          selection is not allowed.
      <li>Attributes do not have Attributes.
  </ul>

  Note that the value of an Attribute can be an <em>Object Reference</em>.  
  A shared Attribute, or an Attribute that is a large array can be implemented as a 
  Reference to a Dataset. 
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">
  See ZZZ below for an explanation of Object References.
  </span>
-->
  
<!-- NEW PAGE -->
  <p>The name, Dataspace and Datatype of the Attribute are specified when it is created, 
  and can not be changed over the life of the Attribute.  The Attribute can be opened by 
  name, by index, or by iterating through all the attributes of the object. 

<h4><em>Property List</em></h4>
  
  <p>HDF5 has a generic Property List object, which is a collection of (<em>name</em>, 
  <em>value</em>) pairs.  Each class of Property List has a specific set of Properties.  
  Each Property has an implicit name, an HDF5 Datatype, and a value (Figure 11).
  A Property List object is created and used similar to the other objects of the 
  HDF5 library.
  
  <p>Property Lists are attached to the object in the library, they can be used by 
  any part of the library. Some properties are permanent (e.g., the chunking strategy 
  for a dataset), others are transient (e.g., buffer sizes for data transfer). 
  A common use of a Property List is to pass parameters from the calling program 
  to a VFL driver or a module of the pipeline.
  
  <p>Property Lists are conceptually similar to Attributes. Property Lists are 
  information relevant to the behavior of the library, while Attributes are 
  relevant to the user's data and application.</p>

<h3 class=pagebefore>3. The HDF5 Storage Model</h3>
</a>

<h4>3.1. The Abstract Storage Model: the HDF5 Format Specification</h4> 
  
  <p><a name="SupScript1">The <em>HDF5 Format Specification</em> 
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">[ [ [
  [cite it] 
  ] ] ]</span>
-->
  defines how the HDF5 objects 
  and data are mapped to a <em>linear address space</em>. The address space is 
  assumed to be a contiguous array of bytes, stored on some random access 
  medium.<a href="#FootNote"><sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></a> 
  The HDF5 Format defines the standard for how the objects of the 
  HDF5 Abstract Data Model are mapped to the linear addresses. The stored 
  representation is self-describing in the sense that the Format defines all 
  the information necessary to read and reconstruct the original 
  objects of the ADM.</a>
  
  <p>The HDF5 Format Specification is organized in three parts:

  <ol>
      <li><strong>Level 0</strong>: File Signature and Super Block
      <li><strong>Level 1</strong>: File Infrastructure
        <ol type="a">
          <li><strong>Level 1A</strong>: B-link Trees and B-tree nodes.
          <li><strong>Level 1B</strong>: Group
          <li><strong>Level 1C</strong>: Group Entry
          <li><strong>Level 1D</strong>: Local Heaps
          <li><strong>Level 1E</strong>: Global Heap
          <li><strong>Level 1F</strong>:  Free-space index
        </ol>
      <li><strong>Level 2</strong>: Data Object
        <ol type="a">
          <li><strong>Level 2A</strong>: Data Object Headers
          <li><strong>Level 2B</strong>: Shared Data Object Headers
          <li><strong>Level 2C</strong>: Data Object Data Storage
        </ol>
  </ol>

  <p>The <strong>Level 0</strong> specification defines the header block for 
  the file, which has a signature, version information, key parameters of the file 
  layout (such as which VFL file drivers are needed) and pointers to the rest of 
  the file. <strong>Level 1</strong> defines the data structures used throughout 
  the file: the B-trees, heaps, and groups. <strong>Level 2</strong> defines the 
  data structure for storing the data objects and data. In all cases, the data 
  structures are completely specified so that every bit in the file can be 
  faithfully interpreted.

  <p>It is important to realize that the structures defined in the HDF5 File 
  Format are not the same as the Abstract Data Model: the object headers, heaps, 
  and B-trees of the HDF5 File Specification are not represented in the Abstract 
  Data Model. The HDF5 Format defines a number of objects for managing the storage, 
  including header blocks, B-trees, and heaps. The <em>HDF5 Format Specification</em> 
  defines how the Abstract objects (Groups, Datasets, etc.) are represented as headers, 
  B-tree blocks, etc.. 

  <p>The HDF5 Library implements operations to write HDF5 objects to the linear 
  format and to read from the linear format to create HDF5 objects. It is important 
  to realize that a single HDF5 object, such as a <em>Dataset</em>, is usually stored 
  as several objects (a header, one or more blocks for data, etc.), which may 
  well not be contiguous on disk.

<!-- NEW PAGE -->
<h4>3.2. Concrete Storage Model</h4>
  
  <p>The HDF5 Format defines an abstract linear address space. This can be implemented 
  in different storage media, such as a single file, multiple files, or memory. 
  The HDF5 Library defines an open interface, called the <em>Virtual File Layer</em> 
  (VFL), that allows different concrete storage models to be selected. 
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">
  See Ch. XXX and the VFL document [cite].
  </span>
-->
  
  <p>The Virtual File Layer defines an abstract model and API for random access storage, 
  and an API to plug in alternative VFL driver modules. The model defines the operations 
  that the VFL driver must and may support, and the plug-in API enables the HDF5 Library 
  to recognize the driver and pass it control and data.
  
  <p>The HDF5 Library defines six VFL drivers: serial unbuffered, serial buffered, 
  memory, MPI/IO, family of files, and split files (Figure 12, Table 2). 
  Other drivers may also be available, such as a socket stream driver or 
  Globus driver, and new drivers can be added.<p>
  
<table x-use-null-cells
		width=300
		cellspacing=0
                class="fullImgTable"

    <td align=center class="fullImgTableCapCell"> 
        <span class=figurenumber>Figure 12. Conceptual hierarchy of 
	VFL drivers.</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <p>Each driver isolates the details of reading and writing storage, so the rest 
  of the HDF5 Library and user program can be almost the same for different storage 
  methods. The exception to this rule is that some VFL drivers need information from 
  the calling application, passed using property lists. For example, the MPI/IO driver 
  requires certain control information that must be provided by the application.</p>

<h3 class=pagebefore>4. The Structure of an HDF5 File</h3>
</a>

<h4>4.1. Overall File Structure</h4>
  
  <p>An HDF5 file is organized as a rooted, directed graph. The Named Data Objects 
  are the nodes of the graph, and the links are the directed arcs. Each arc of the 
  graph has a name, the root group has the name "/". Objects are created and then 
  inserted into the graph with the link operation, which creates a named link from 
  a Group to the object. For example, Figure 38 illustrates the structure of an HDF5 
  file when one dataset is created. An object can be the 
  target of more than one link.</p>

  <p><a name="SupScript3">The names on the links must be unique within each Group, but there may be many 
  links with the same name in different groups. These are unambiguous, because some 
  ancestor must have a different name, or else they are the same object. The graph 
  is navigated with path names, analogous to Unix file systems. 
<!-- editingComment
  <span class="editingComment">[ [ [
  [cite something]
  ] ] ]</span>
-->
  An object can be opened with a full path starting at the root group, or with a 
  relative path and a starting node (Group). Note that all paths are relative to a 
  single HDF5 File. In this sense, an HDF5 File is analogous 
  to a single Unix File System.</a>
  <a href="#FootNote"><sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup></a>
  
  <p>It is important to note that, just like the Unix file system, the Objects 
  do not have <em>names</em>, the names are associated with <em>paths</em>. 
  An object has a unique (within the file) <em>object id</em>, but a single object 
  can have many <em>names</em> because there are many paths to the same object. 
  An object can be renamed (moved to another Group) by adding and deleting links. 
  In this case, the object itself never moves.  For that matter, membership in a 
  Group has no implication for the physical location of the stored object.
  
<!-- NEW PAGE -->
  <p><a name="SupScript4">Deleting a link to an object does not necessarily delete the object. The 
  object remains available as long as there is at least one link to it.  After 
  all links to an object are deleted, it can no longer be opened, although the 
  storage may or may not be reclaimed.</a>
  <a href="#FootNote"><sup><font size="-1">4</font></sup></a>
  
  <p>It is important to realize that the linking mechanism can be used to construct 
  very complex graphs of objects. For example, it is possible for object to be 
  shared between several groups and even to have more than one name in the same group. 
  It is also possible for a group to be a member of itself, or create other 
  "cycles" in the graph, such as a case where a child is the parent of one 
  of its own ancestors. 
  
  <p>HDF5 also has <em>Soft Links</em> similar to Unix soft links. 
  A <em>Soft Link</em> is an object that contains a name and a path name for the 
  target object. The Soft Link can be followed to open the target of the link, 
  just like a regular (hard) link. Unlike hard Links, the target of a Soft Link has 
  no count of the Soft Link to it.  The reference count of an object is the number of 
  hard Links (which must be >= 1). A second difference is that the hard link cannot 
  be created if the target object does not exist, and always points to the same object. 
  A Soft Link can be created with any path name, whether or not the object exists. 
  Therefore, it may or may not be possible to follow a Soft Link, or the target object 
  may change from one access to another access of the same Soft Link.

<h4>4.2. HDF5 Path Names and Navigation</h4>
  
  <p>The structure of the file constitutes the name space for the objects in the file. 
  A path name is a string of components separated by '/'. Each component is the name 
  of a (hard or soft) link, or the special characters "." (meaning current group). 
  Link names (components) can be any string of ASCII characters not containing '/' 
  (except the string ".", which is reserved). However, users are advised to avoid 
  the use of punctuation and non-printing characters, because they may create 
  problems for other software. Figure 39 gives a BNF grammar for 
  HDF5 <em>path names</em>.</p>

  <p>An object can always be addressed by a <em>full or absolute path</em>, i.e., 
  starting at the root group.  As already noted, a given object can have more 
  than one full path name. An object can also be addressed by a relative path, 
  i.e., a group plus a path starting at the group. 
  
  <p>The structure of an HDF5 file is "self-describing", in that it is possible 
  to <em>navigate</em> the file to discover all the objects in the file. Basically, 
  the structure is traversed as a graph, starting at one node, and recursively 
  visiting the nodes of the graph.
  
  <p>The members of a Group can be discovered with the H5Giterate function, 
  and a description of the object can be retrieved with the H5Gget_obj_info function. 
  In this way, all the members of a given group can be determined, and each can be 
  opened to retrieve a description, or the data and attributes of the object.

<h4>4.3. Examples of HDF5 File Structures</h4>
  
  <p>Figure 40 shows some examples of the structure of a file with three groups and 
  one dataset. Figure 40a shows the structure of a file with three groups, the root 
  with two members. Figure 40b shows a dataset created in "/group1". Figure 40c shows 
  the structure after the dataset is linked (with H5Glink) to "/group2" with the name 
  "dset2". Note that there is only one copy of the dataset, it has two different links 
  to it and can be accessed by two different paths:  "/group1/dset1" and "/group2/dset2".
  
  <p>Figure 40d shows that one of the two links to the dataset can be deleted 
  (with H5Gunlink()). In this case, the link from "/group1" is removed.  The dataset 
  is not deleted, it is still in the file but can only be 
  accessed as "/group1/dset2".</p>
