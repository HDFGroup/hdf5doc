<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The proliferation of sensors and other instruments introduces enormous challenges 
to data management.  Even for a single event, incoming synchronized time-sequenced 
data can have many sources, and the number of incoming data streams, as well as the 
types of data, can be large.  In Boeing's flight test data applications, for instance, 
data arrives from test aircraft, voice communications, video, ground, satellite tracking, 
and other sources.  This data must be gathered, integrated, processed, visualized, 
and archived.  Similar scenarios exist for many different applications, such as environmental 
monitoring, vehicle testing, and medicine.

<p>The collection and storing of these kinds of data historically have been reduced to 
unique in-house implementations.  There is surprisingly little sharing of these infrastructure 
technologies even within an application area, let alone across application domains, 
resulting in frequent and costly re-invention of the same technologies.

<p>HDF5 provides, in a single package, many of the capabilities that otherwise have to 
be developed from scratch.  HDF5 can store virtually any kind of scientific or engineering 
data and to mix any number of objects of different types in a single container.  
HDF5 can support different access patterns, simplified data integration, datatype 
translation, fast I/O, and visualization and analysis software.

<h2>Using the HDF5 Packet Table</h2> 

<p>The following example describes the typical use of the HDF5 Packet Table API.

<p><strong>Writing homogeneous, fixed-sized packets of instrument data</strong>.  
An experimenter wants to store measurements from a fixed number of sensors.  
All measurements taken at the same time are collected and transmitted in a "packet", 
including a time stamp.  The packet contents are to be saved as a record in a table. 
(Figure 1.) To do this, the experimenter can create an HDF5 datatype representing a 
fixed-size "packet" of data in an HDF5 file.  This can be any atomic HDF5 datatype, 
or it could be a compound datatype.  Each packet corresponds to a fixed-length 
horizontal entry, or "record," in a table.

<h2>HDF5 Packet library for flight test data</h2>

<p>Boeing's Flight Test Instrumentations Group and the HDF5 development group at the 
University of Illinois have developed a library that is particularly suited for "packet" 
data, data that arrives in streams of packets from instruments at 
potentially very high speeds.

<p>A key to a general-purpose packet I/O library is that, at a certain 
level, all packet data falls into simple structural categories that can 
be handled by fixed-length packets. In this scenario, every record to 
be stored is of the same length.</p>

<p>The Packet Table implementation includes a C API, as well as prototype 
C++ wrapper objects, which are described in the Packet Table Reference 
Manual.</p>

<p><strong>HDF5 "Table" vs. "Packet" APIs</strong>.  The HDF5 packet API is similar to 
but separate from the HDF5 "Table" API, whose prefix is H5TB.  The H5TB Table is designed 
to be as high-level as possible, adding attributes and abstracting away much of HDF5's 
internal workings.  In contrast, the Packet Table API, whose prefix is H5PT, is a lower-level 
approach, designed to maximize throughput (as is needed in real-time applications).  
The Packet Table thus provides bare-bones table functionality with essentially no overhead.

<h2>Programming with the Packet library</h2>

<p>Packet Tables have states, and must be opened and closed like HDF5 objects.  
Thus the Packet Table programming model is similar to that for working with other types 
of HDF5 objects:

<ol>
  <li>An HDF5 file is created or opened.
  <li>The location of the object of interest is obtained.
  <li>The Packet Table is created or opened using the Packet Table API.
  <li>Operations are carried out on the Packet Table.
  <li>The Packet Table is closed
  <li>Other relevant objects are closed as necessary.
</ol>

<p>The Packet Table API covers steps 3-5.  See the HDF5 documentation for information on 
how to do the other steps.

<p>The following operations can be performed on Packet Tables:

<ol type="1">
  <li>Create and open Packet Table
    <ol type="a">
	  <li>Create packet table with fixed-size record
	</ol>
  <li>Close Packet Table
  <li>Write and read Packet Table
    <ol type="a">
	  <li>Append packet(s)
      <li>Position pointer for read operation
      <li>Read packet(s) starting at specified position in the table
	</ol>
  <li>Query properties of Packet Table
    <ol type="a">
	  <li>Number of packets in the Packet Table
      <li>If an HDF5 object is a Packet Table
	</ol>
</ol>

<p>Packet Table APIs implement those operations. Full descriptions of Packet Table 
APIs can be found on the <a href="RM_H5PT.html">H5PT: HDF5 Packet Table</a> page
of the <a href="../RM/RM_H5Front.html"><cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite></a>.


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The example below demonstrates the use of the C language version of 
the Packet Table API to create a packet table with fixed-length 
records and to perform writes and reads.
