<!-- THIS FILE EXISTS TO GUIDE USERS TO THE CORRECT RELEASE DOCS.   -->
<!-- Install and update it as hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/doc-info.html.  -->

<p>
The HDF Group currently supports only the HDF5 Release 1.8.x series.
This page provides a link to Release 1.6.x series documentation 
for users who have not yet been able to upgrade.
<!--
The HDF Group currently supports two concurrent releases of HDF5.
Since there are substantial differences in these releases, this page 
enables users to locate the desired documentation set.

<p>Note that the Release 1.8.x series includes a means of fully emulating 
   1.6.x series functionality.
   Many 1.6.x users will be able to meet their needs, 
   <i>while also taking advantage of 1.8.x performance enhancements</i>, 
   by configuring and installing Release 1.8.x accordingly.
