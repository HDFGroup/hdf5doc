enables users to locate the desired documentation set.

<h2>HDF5 Release 1.8.3</h2>

   New projects are strongly encouraged to use this release as it contains

<h2>HDF5 Release 1.6.9</h2>


<p>Release 1.6.9 is the latest release in the 1.6.x series.  
   This release is supported for users with existing major projects 
   that cannot be ported to the latest release.  
   Users with tools that have not been ported to the newer release 
   may also need to use this release.</p>

    </ul>
</p>

<p>Note that the 1.8.x release series includes a means of fully emulating 
   1.6.x series functionality.
   Many 1.6.x users will be able to meet their needs, 
   <i>while also taking advantage of several of the 1.8.x
   performance enhancements</i>, 
   by configuring and installing Release 1.8.x accordingly.
   See <A HREF="RM/APICompatMacros.html">
