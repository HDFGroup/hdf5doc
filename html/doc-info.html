The HDF Group currently supports two concurrent releases of HDF5.
Since there are substantial differences in these releases, this page 
enables users to locate the desired documentation set.

<h2>HDF5 Release 1.8.0</h2>


<p>Release 1.8.0 is the current release.  
   New projects are strongly encouraged to use this release as it contains 
   many new features, file optimizations, and performance enhancements.</p>

</p>

<hr>
<h2>HDF5 Release 1.6.6</h2>


<p>Release 1.6.6 is the latest release in the 1.6 series.  
   This release is supported for users with existing major projects 
   that cannot be ported to the latest release.  
   Users with tools that have not been ported to the newer release 
   may also need to use this release.</p>

		<li class="li"><A HREF="/HDF5/doc1.6/">http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.6/</A></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that Release 1.8.0 includes a means of fully emulating 
   Release 1.6.6 functionality.
   Many 1.6.x users will be able to meet their needs, 
   <i>while also taking advantage of several of 1.8.0&rsquo;s 
   performance enhancements</i>, 
   by configuring and installing Release 1.8.0 accordingly.
   See <A HREF="/HDF5/doc/RM/APICompatMacros.html">
   <cite>API Compatibility Macros in HDF5</cite></a> for details.</p>
