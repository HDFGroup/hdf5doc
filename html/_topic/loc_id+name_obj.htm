<strong>
Accessing objects by location and name:
</strong></a>

<p>To work with an HDF5 object, an application needs the object's 
location identifier. An object's location identifier is returned to an 
application after the object is opened. </p>

<p>To open an object, an application uses a function with three parameters: 
the location identifier of an already opened object, a path from the already 
opened object to the object that will be opened, and a property list. The 
location identifier of an already opened object is its <code>loc_id</code>. 
An already opened object might be a file or a group. The path from the 
already opened object to the object that will be opened is kept in 
the <code>name</code> parameter. The path will be one or more links. 
For the rest of this discussion, we will assume that the default property 
list, <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code>, is used. </p>

<p>See the <i>HDF5 Reference Manual</i> entries for the <code>H5Dopen</code>, 
<code>H5Gopen</code>, <code>H5Oopen</code>, and <code>H5Topen</code> 
functions for more information on opening datasets, groups, objects, and 
datatypes.</p>


<br /><br /><br />
an identifier from the file where the object is located and the 
path from the identifier to the object. The identifier is usually 
known as <code>loc_id</code>. <code>loc_id</code> is short for 
location identifier. The path from the identifer is 
</p>

<br /><br /><br />
<p>* 
<p> ??????? The process of identifying an object is to specify a path to 
the object from a known location. </p>

<p>Suppose we wanted to read the dataset that is the target of the 
<code>dset3</code> link in the figure below. The <code>H5Dread</code> 
function call needs an identifier for the dataset. How does an application 
go about getting that identifier?</p>



<p>The identifier that is returned from this process 
can then be used when the object is operated on.



The <code>loc_id</code> and <code>name</code> 
parameters are used in many HDF5 function calls to specify a known 
location 

</p>








<p>??????? </p>


<p>Many HDF5 function calls use a combination of a location and name
to identify an HDF5 object. </p>
<p>
The location will be specified by a location identifier, <code>loc_id</code>, 
and will be an HDF5 file or object such as a group, dataset, or committed 
datatype*. </p>

<p>
The name parameter, <code>name</code>, will be a character string and
will specify the links to an object in an HDF5 file.
The link or links to the object will be either an absolute path 
or a relative path. An absolute path will include all of the links from 
the root group to the object. A relative path will include all of the 
links from any other group to the object.</p>

<p>
Several <code>loc_id</code> and <code>name</code> combinations are 
possible. To illustrate, the following combinations all identify 
<code>dset3</code> in the file structure in the figure.
<ul>
    <li>If <code>loc_id</code> is a file identifier,
        <code>name</code> must specify the object from the file&rsquo;s
        root group.
        <p>
        <code>loc_id</code> specifies the file <code>DATA_FILE1</code>.
        <br>
        <code>name = '/group2/group3/dset3'</code>                      &nbsp;
<!--
        <p>
        (Note that a file is always identified by a filename, 
        <code>file_name</code> or <code>name</code>, 
        or by a file identifier, <code>file_id</code> or <code>loc_id</code>; 
        files are not identified by a 
        <code>loc_id</code> / <code>name</code> combination.)
-->
    <li>If <code>loc_id</code> is a group identifier 
        and the object of interest is a member of that group,
        <code>name</code> will simply be the name of the link to the object.
        <p>
        <code>loc_id</code> specifies <code>group3</code>.
        <br>
        <code>name = 'dset3'</code>                                    &nbsp;
    <li>If <code>loc_id</code> is a group identifier 
        but the object of interest is not a direct member of that group,
        <code>name</code> would specify the object by a path relative 
        to that group.
        <p>
        <code>loc_id</code> specifies <code>group2</code>.
        <br>
        <code>name = 'group3/dset3'</code> 
        <p>
        Alternatively, <code>name</code> could specify the object 
        with an absolute path in the file containing <code>loc_id</code>.
        <p>
        <code>loc_id</code> specifies <code>group2</code>.
        <br>
        <code>name = '/group2/group3/dset3'</code>                     &nbsp;
    <li>There is one special case:
        if <code>loc_id</code> is the identifier of the object itself,
        <code>name</code> should be a dot (&nbsp;<code>.</code>&nbsp;).
        For those familiar with a UNIX shell, this works in much the 
        same manner as a dot (&nbsp;<code>.</code>&nbsp;)
        specifying the current working directory.
        <p>
        <code>loc_id</code> specifies <code>dset3</code>, the dataset itself.
        <br>
        <code>name = '.'</code>                                         &nbsp;
</ul>

<p>
Many HDF5 functions accept <code>loc_id</code> and <code>name</code> 
in all of the above combinations.
When accepted combinations are limited for a specific function, 
the limitations are mentioned in the function&rsquo;s reference manual entry.
