<h5>Writing one kind of data to a fixed-length packet table</h5>

<p>An experimenter wants to store data from a single kind of sensor in a
Packet Table. First, she must create or load an HDF5 datatype representing
a &quot;packet&quot; of her data. This can be any valid HDF5 datatype,
though it is likely to be a compound datatype, since each packet corresponds
to a horizontal entry in a table. If the experimenter has used HDF5 in the
past, she may have already created a datatype representing her data and
can simply load it from a file.  This step is covered in more detail in
the HDF5 User&rsquo;s Guide.<br>
The experimenter then creates the packet table. She must specify the
location (file or group identifier), name, and datatype of the new packet
table. Her function call might look like this:</p>

<p><code>hid_t ptable_id= H5PTcreate_fl( file_id, &quot;/trial1&quot;, datatype_id, 500 );</code></p>

<p>The last argument is the &quot;chunk size,&quot; which affects how
HDF5 stores data in the file; the experimenter may fine-tune this number
later. Chunked storage is discussed in more detail in the HDF5 User's
Guide.<br>
Now the experimenter starts the experiment itself. Each time a sensor
takes a reading, the data is stored in a buffer, which the experimenter
uses to create an entry in the packet table:</p>

<p><code>ret_value= H5PTappend( ptable_id, 1, &amp;(dataBuffer) );</code></p>

<p>The above statement executes inside a loop and is called to add a new
packet every time a new sensor reading is placed in the data buffer.<br>
When the experiment is over, the experimenter closes the packet table.</p>

<p><code>ret_value= H5PTclose( ptable_id );</code></p>

<p>She may also wish the close the HDF5 file if she is done accessing it.

<br />
<br />
<h5>Reading data from a fixed-length packet table</h5>

<p>An analyst wants to read from a fixed-length packet table like the one
created by the experimenter above.<br>
First, he must open the packet table. To do this, he needs to know its
location and name.</p>

<p><code>hid_t ptable_id= H5PTopen( file_id, &quot;/trial1&quot; );</code></p>

<p>Once the packet table is open, the analyst wants to discover how many
packets it contains.</p>

<p><code>hsize_t num_packets;<br>
ret_value= H5PTget_num_packets( ptable_id, &amp;num_packets );</code></p>

<p>The analyst then begins to read records one-by-one from the beginning
of the packet table. He sets the packet table's index to the first packet.</p>

<p><code>ret_value= H5PTcreate_index( ptable_id );</code></p>

<p>Then, he creates a for-loop to read each packet into a buffer and
perform his analysis on it.</p>

<p><code>for(int x=0; x&lt;num_packets; x++) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ret_value= H5PTget_next( ptable_id, 1, &amp;(readBuffer) );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Perform analysis on readBuffer<br>
}</code></p>

<p>The analyst may want to read several packets into a larger buffer, and
start from an arbitrary index without losing his place in the table. To
read twenty packets starting from packet number 400, he uses the following
call:</p>

<p><code>ret_value= H5PTread_packets( ptable_id, 400, 20, &amp;(bigReadBuffer) ); </code></p>

<p>Finally, the analyst closes the packet table.</p>

<p><code>ret_value= H5PTclose(ptable_id);</code></p>

<p>He may also wish to close the HDF5 file, or he may go on to examine
other objects in the same file.

<br />
<br />
<h5>Handling an unknown packet table identifier</h5>

<p>A function receives an identifier from another location in the program
and the programmer wishes to confirm that it is the packet table she
is expecting.</p>

<p>First, she checks that it is in fact a packet table and that it has been
opened.</p>

<p><code>ret_value= H5PTis_valid( ptable_id );</code></p>

<p>If the identifier does not refer to an open packet table, the return
value will be negative.</p>

<p>The programmer may need to remember to close the packet table, depending
on the semantics of the application.</p>
