<DL>
    <DT><STRONG>What is this document about?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>This document describes some limitations of the current HDF5 datatype
            conversion overflow behavior, new requirements for the overflow
            behavior and describes a solution for covering those requirements.
        </DD> <BR>

    <DT><STRONG>How does the overflow callback currently operate?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>
            <P>The HDF5 library's current behavior when converting a value from one
            datatype to another is to issue a call to the "overflow" callback whenever
            a source value is outside of the range of values representable by the
            destination datatype.  If the overflow callback is not set or is set,
            but indicates that it hasn't handled the overflow (by returning a
            negative value when called), the destination
            value is set to either the maximum or minimum destination value (depending if
            the source value was beyond the maximum or minimum destination value
            respectively).  The development branch of the HDF5 library (v1.7.x) extends
            this behavior to it's support for int &lt;-&gt; float type conversions.
            </P>
            <P>
            For example, when converting from a signed 16-bit
            integer to an unsigned 16-bit integer, negative source values would trigger
            a call to the overflow callback, and if it didn't exist or handle the overflow,
            the minimum unsigned 16-bit integer (0) would be used as the destination value.
            Likewise, when converting from a signed 32-bit integer to a signed 16-bit
            integer, source values greater than 32767 or less than -32768 would trigger
            a call to the overflow callback and would be set to 32767 or -32768
            (respectively) if the overflow callback didn't exist or didn't handle the
            exception.
            </P>
        </DD> <BR>

    <DT><STRONG>What is the prototype for the current conversion callback?</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>
            <P>Here's the prototype for the overflow callback routine:
            <pre>herr_t (*H5T_overflow_t)(hid_t src_id, hid_t dst_id, void *src_buf, void *dst_buf);</pre>
            </P>
        </DD> <BR>
</DL>

<LI><H3><U>New Requirements:</U></H3>

<P>There are several new requirements listed here, in order of decreasing
importance:
    <UL>
        <LI>Support netCDF-3 type conversion behavior.  It's not obvious from
            the background information about the netCDF-3 above, but netCDF-3
            replaces "out of bound" values with the fill value for the dataset,
            in addition to issuing an error.  We will need to be able to pass
            the appropriate fill-value for a datatype to the overflow callback
            in order to support this use case.
        <LI>Indicate type of "overflow".  Now that we are performing
            int &lt;-&gt; float type conversions, there are different kinds
            of conversion exceptions that are possible.  There are "range"
            errors (as we've previously had) and now there can be "loss of
            precision" errors for int -&gt; float conversions and "truncation"
            errors for float -&gt; int conversions.  The type of the conversion
            exception should be passed to the overflow routine.  This is
            particularly important for netCDF-3 emulation, which only replaces
            the destination value with the fill value for "range" errors, not
            for the other types of errors.
        <LI>Allow for "user data" to reach the callback.  The general rule in
            HDF5 callbacks is to allow a "void *" which the application sets
            to be passed in to a callback routine.  This would allow
            applications to pass along any custom information that the callback
            would need.  The fill value mentioned above can be passed into the 
            callback through this "void *".
        <LI>Make the callback a non-global setting.  Currently there is one
            global "overflow" callback for the HDF5 library.  It should be
            possible to set a callback on a per-data-transfer basis.
        <LI>Allow for the callback to indicate the conversion should stop.
            Currently the conversion of data values continues through the
            entire buffer of values to convert.  It would be nice if there were
            a way for the callback routine to indicate that further values
            should not be converted.
    </UL>
</P>

<LI><H3><U>Suggested Changes:</U></H3>

<P>To accomodate the requirements above, changing the prototype of the
"overflow" callback is necessary, as well as attaching it to a data transfer
property list and changing the library's behavior for the return values of
the callback.  I would also suggest changing the name from an "overflow"
callback to the more generic "type conversion exception callback".
</P>

<P>After accomodating the changes above, the prototype would look like this:
    <pre>H5T_conv_ret_t (*H5T_conv_except_func_t)(H5T_conv_except_t except_type,
        hid_t src_id, hid_t dst_id, void *src_buf, void *dst_buf, void *user_data);
    </pre>
</P>

<P>The parameters are as follows:
<UL>
    <LI><CODE>exception_type</CODE> - The type of exception (enum described
        below).
    <LI><CODE>src_id</CODE> - A datatype ID describing the source datatype.
    <LI><CODE>dst_id</CODE> - A datatype ID describing the destination datatype.
    <LI><CODE>src_buf</CODE> - A pointer to the buffer containing the source value.
    <LI><CODE>dst_buf</CODE> - A pointer to the buffer where the destination value should
        be placed.
    <LI><CODE>user_data</CODE> - A pointer to the "user data" set by the application that
        registered the conversion callback.
</UL>
</P>

<P>The <CODE>H5T_conv_except_t</CODE> enumerated type has the following values:
<UL>
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_RANGE_HI</CODE> - The source value is greater
        than the range of values that can be encoded in the destination value.
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_RANGE_LOW</CODE> - The source value is less than
        the range of values that can be encoded in the destination value.
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_PRECISION</CODE> - The source value will suffer a
        loss of precision when it is represented in the destination type.
        (This generally occurs when very large integers are converted to
        floating-point types)
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_EXCEPT_TRUNCATE</CODE> - The source value will suffer a
        truncation in value when it is represented in the destination type.
        (This generally occurs when floating-point values with fractional
        values are converted to integer datatypes)
</UL>
</P>

<P>The return value from conversion callbacks is <CODE>H5T_conv_ret_t</CODE>,
a new enumerated type with the following values:
<UL>
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_ABORT</CODE> - Abort type conversion immediately (-1).
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_UNHANDLED</CODE> - Conversion callback did not
        handled the conversion exception and the HDF5 library should perform
        whatever default conversion it normally applies (0).
    <LI><CODE>H5T_CONV_HANDLED</CODE> - Conversion callback 
        handled the conversion exception and the HDF5 library should
        <EM>not</EM> perform whatever default conversion it normally applies (1).
</UL>
</P>

<P>Additionally, the <code>H5Tset_overflow</code> and
<code>H5Tget_overflow</code> routines would be retired in favor of 
the following routines:

<LI><H3><U>Compatibility With Version 1.6:</U></H3>

<p>As we try to switch the API from H5Tset(get)_overflow to H5Pset(get)_type_conv_cb,
we may encounter backward compatibility issue.  We have a few options here:

<DL>
    <DT><STRONG>Option 1</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>Simply discard the old API functions(H5Tset(get)_overflow).  This is
            an easy solution.  Hopefully, there are not many major users having
            these functions in their program.  Those failing programs have to
            migrate to the new design with functions H5Pset(get)_type_conv_cb. 
        </DD> <BR>

    <DT><STRONG>Option 2</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>Keep the old API functions for some time during the transition.
            User programs do not have to adopt the new functions.  In case someone
            happens to set both of the old and new callback functions, we give the
            new one green light to proceed.
            </P>
        </DD> <BR>

    <DT><STRONG>Option 3</STRONG></DT>
        <DD>Keep the names of the old API functions but return error messages
            when they are executed.  Just remind users there are new API functions
            available.
        </DD> <BR>
</DL>

This issue is like what we face whenever we try to change API functions.  We 
should do it according our API change policy if we have one in hand. 

<LI><H3><U>Discussion:</U></H3>

<P>With the above changes to the library, the datatype conversion code will be
able to fulfill all the new requirements listed.  Supporting the new type
conversion exception callback and detecting the new exception types (loss of
precision and truncation) will require some additional coding, but not a huge
amount.  Adding support for detecting the new exception types will make the
int &lt;-&gt; float conversions slightly slower and more complex though.
</P>

<P>If fill value is needed when conversion exception happens, it can be passed
in through the user data(a void pointer) in the callback or can be made a global 
variable.  To find the fill value is user's responsibility.  They can retrieve it 
from the dataset transfer property list easily.
</P>
