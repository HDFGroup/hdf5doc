  <p>
  <dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
    <dd>Sets bounds on library versions, and indirectly format versions, to be used 
        when creating objects.
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Description:</strong>
    <dd><code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code> controls the versions of the object formats
        that will be used when creating objects in a file.  The object format versions 
        are determined indirectly from the HDF5 Library versions specified in the call.
        <p>
        This property is set in the file access property list specified
        by <code>fapl_id</code>. 
  <p>
  <dt><strong>Parameters:</strong>
    <dd><table>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><em>hid_t</em> <code>fapl_id</code>

        </td>
        <td valign="top">IN: The earliest version of the library that will be used
            for writing objects.  The library version indirectly specifies the earliest object 
            format version that can be used when creating objects in the file.
            <p>
            Currently, <code>low</code> must be one of two pre-defined values:
            <p>
            Setting <code>low</code> to <code>H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST</code> will result in 
            objects being created using the <em>earliest possible</em> format 
            for each object. 
            Note that <em>earliest possible</em> is different from 
            <em>earliest</em>, as some features introduced in library versions
            later than 1.0.0 resulted in updates to object formats.  
            With <code>low</code>=<code>H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST</code>, 
            if the application creates an object that requires a feature introduced
            in library versions later than 1.0.0, the earliest possible version
            that supports the requested feature will be used. 
            <p>
            The upper bound
            on the range of possible library versions used to create the object
            is controlled by the <code>high</code> parameter.
            <p>
            This is the default behavior of the library if 
            <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code> is not called.
            <p>
            Setting <code>low</code> to <code>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</code> will result in 
            objects being created using the <em>latest available</em> format for each object.   
            This setting means that objects will be created with the latest format versions 
            available (within the range of library versions specified in the call),
            and can take advantage of the latest features and performance enhancements.
            
            Objects written with the <code>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</code> setting for 
            <code>low</code> may be accessible to a smaller range of library versions 
            than would be the case if the <code>H5F_LIBVER_EARLIEST</code> value had been used.
