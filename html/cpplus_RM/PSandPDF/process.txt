PDF versions of the HDF5 Reference Manual (RM) and the new HDF5 User's Guide 
(UG) are created from the HTML source at each release of the HDF5 Library.  
The process is managed through two application environments, DreamWeaver (an 
HTML editing environment) and HTMLdoc (a PDF conversion tool).  This document 
describes the process in detail for the RM; the process for the UG is very 
similar and is described in a separate document.

Complete the process first for either the RM or UG, then for the other.


The HDF5 Reference Manual
-------------------------
1.  Skip this step if you have already done it for the UG; you can use the 
    same working copy for both tasks.

    Check out a fresh working copy of the minor release branch specifically
    for this task. For example:
      svn checkout https://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/hdf5doc/branches/hdf5_1_8_4  \
          hdf5_1_8_4-PDFs

    Using Macromedia Dreamweaver, define a site that contains all the 
    documents within the subdirectory html/, including the .html, image, 
    DreamWeaver library (in ed_libs/), and .book files.

2.  Working in DreamWeaver...
    In the ed_libs directory:

      a) Assuming your libraries are set up for electronic viewing (to
         verify, check that there is nothing more than a commented note and
         an '&nbsp;' in the ed_libs/*_Null.lbi libraries), move the code
         from the relevant library files into the respective _Null library 
         files, replacing the &nbsp;.
           
         For example, take all the code from Footer.lbi and insert it into
         Footer_Null.lbi, taking care not to remove the commented note.

         You can ignore any file in ed_libs/ that does not have a corresponding 
         _Null file.

      b) In the now empty library file, add an &nbsp;.

      c) Save the libraries and their respective Null files.

      d) With a library still open (not a Null one) choose 
          Modify>Templates>Update Pages...
         In 'Look in:', select 'Entire Site'.
         In 'Update:', select 'Library Items' and 
                       deselect 'Templates'.
         Click on the 'Start' button.

3a. In RM_H5P.html:

      a) RM_H5P.html contains two versions of the 'C Interfaces' function 
         list; one is for print use (in PDFs) and one is for electronic use 
         (on the website).  
         One version should be visible and one should be commented out.  

         Make sure that the sections bracketed with 
         <!-- FOR USE WITH ELECTRONIC VERSION ---> are commented out
         (by removing the trailing '>' character from the first of each pair 
         of labels).

         Make sure that the sections bracketed with 
         <!-- FOR USE WITH PRINT VERSION ---> are visible (by adding a 
         trailing '>' character to the first of each pair of labels).

         The same convention is used in a scattering of additional files.
         You can locate them with a 'grep' across the doc tree.

3b. Do the same with RM_H5Front.html

4.  Building the section files (H5, H5A, H5D, ... Tools):

      a) Add any new tools to the concatenate_entries script.

      b) Using the script
             RM/concatenate_entries
         assemble files in each of the following directories into a single 
         file:
             RM/H5/
             RM/H5?/
             RM/Tools/

         NOTE that RM/H5/* and RM/H5?/* files are assembled alphabetically 
         while RM/Tools/* files are called in a theoretically logical order.

      c) Insert the concatenated file in place of the server-side include 
         commands in the following files:
             RM_H5.html
             RM_H5?.html (i.e., RM_H5A.html, , RM_H5D.html, RM_H5E.html, etc)
             Tools.html
         Some files will list additional "_topic/" files that must be
         included individually.

      d) Make a pass though the resulting copies of:
             RM_H5.html
             RM_H5?.html
             Tools.html 
         and in:
             fortran/FortranFlags.html
         to bring in the Fortran 'php include' files.

         [ This REALLY needs to be automated!!!  Perhaps it could be built ]
         [ into a Perl script, maybe iven along with the functionality of  ]
         [ 'RM/concatenate_entries'.                                       ]

      e) Review the resulting files in a browser to ensure that everything 
         has meshed well.

      l) Generate the document.

5.  Open HDF5_RM_body.pdf
    
      a) Scan through the document page by page to verify that there are no 
         elements that should have been eliminated via javascripts, swapped 
         comment markup, or swapped DW library content.

      b) Scan through again looking only for places where page breaks need to 
         be added, removed, or relocated.  

      c) Correct pagination and formatting errors as needed and regenerate.
         Make all corrections to be saved for future releases in two places:
         -- In your PDF working copy
         -- In a clean working copy (i.e., one that has not been modified for 
            this PDF-generation process)
 
         REPEAT AS NEEDED.

      d) When all the pagination is correct (don't forget to start each 
         sections included in the Table of Contents on a recto), note page 
         numbers for the beginning of each section in the TOC.

6.  Open RM_TOC.html

      a) Edit page numbers accordingly. 
         (Note: Assuming the general format of RM_H5Front remains the same, 
          the 'Overview' listing in the TOC should always be on pg. 1, and 
          the 'Fortran90 and C++ APIs' listing should be on pg. 2, an 
          exception to the recto-rule.)

      b) Save.

           HTML Editor: Point to Dreamweaver (recommended)
           Browser Width: 680
           GUI Options: Check all 3

      j) Save the book file.

      k) Verify that the output file (H5_RM_front.pdf) is not open.

      l) Generate the document.      


9.  Following a procedure virtually identical to that outlined in (7) above, 
    use the file PDF_C_and_L.book to generate a 1-page copyright and license 
    statement.

    This page can be generated once and used in both the RM and UG PDFs.  

    Adjust the font size if the copyright and license statement does not 
    initially fit on one page.  To do this, open PDF_C_and_L.book in HTMLdoc; 
    font control is under the "Fonts" tab in the HTMLdoc application window.


10. Using Adobe Acrobat Pro:

      a) Insert the Copyright page into the frontmatter file and remove any 
         blank pages that prevent the TOC or any subsequent material from 
         appearing on a recto.

         The resulting page order should be as follows:

             Title page            (recto)
             Copyright page        (on the back of the title page)
             TOC                   (starts on a recto; may be several pages)
             additional material   (starts on a recto; may be several pages)

         The resulting file is your final frontmatter file.

      b) Insert the frontmatter file at the front of the previously-generated
         body file.

         Acrobat can be finicky.  
         -- Save the file and quit Acrobat after each "Insert pages" or 
            "Delete pages" operation.  
         -- If you get an error, try doing things in a different order; 
            e.g., if you get an error inserting the body at the end of the
            frontmatter, try inserting the frontmatter to the beginning of 
            the body.

         NOTE OF 10 November 2011 
         The following order of operations worked today:
            -- Quit and restart Adobe Acrobat Pro for each of the following 
               steps.
            -- Remove the blank title page verso.
            -- Remove the blank copyright and license page (C&L) recto.
            -- With the frontmatter file open, insert the C&L following 
               the title page.
            -- With the frontmatter file open, insert the RM body following 
               the last frontmatter page.

      c) Update the PDF bookmarks.  

         You will be correcting two problems:  First, the default text for 
         the automatically-generated bookmarks is generally inadequate; 
         replace them with more descriptive text.  Second, the process of 
         trinmming and merging files scrambles the bookmarks pretty badly.

      d) Name the resulting file consistently with the names of UG and RM PDFs 
         from prior releases.
         For history, one copy of the RM PDF file will be in the format:
             HDF5_RM_r188.pdf
         To enable links that always point to an up-to-date version, 
         a second copy of the RM PDF file will be in the format:
             HDF5_RefManual.PDF


11. Update this 'process.txt' file.


12. Commit the updated 'process.txt' and all of the edits mentioned in step 5
    (see 5c).

        Final UG and RM PDFs 
        Pagination and other changes in the content files
        Updates to the HTMLdoc .book files.
        Any other changes for this process that should be saved for future use
 
    Make sure all commits are merged, as appropriate, to other branches and
    to the repository trunk.
