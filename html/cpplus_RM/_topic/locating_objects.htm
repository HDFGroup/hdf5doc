<strong>Locating objects in the HDF5 file hierarchy:</strong></a>
<br>
An object name consists of one or more components separated from
one another by slashes. An absolute name begins with a slash and the
object is located by looking for the first component in the root
object, then looking for the second component in the first object, etc.,
until the entire name is traversed.  A relative name does not begin 
with a slash and the traversal begins at the location specified by the 
create or access function.
