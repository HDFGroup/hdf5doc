<strong>Groups in HDF5:</strong></a>
<br>
A group associates names with objects and provides a mechanism
for mapping a name to an object. Since all objects appear in at 
least one group (with the possible exception of the root object) 
and since objects can have names in more than one group, the set 
of all objects in an HDF5 file is a directed graph.  The internal
nodes (nodes with out-degree greater than zero) must be groups 
while the leaf nodes (nodes with out-degree zero) are either empty 
groups or objects of some other type.  Exactly one object in every 
non-empty file is the root object.  The root object always has a 
positive in-degree because it is pointed to by the file super block.
