<strong>Group implementations in HDF5:</strong></a>
<!--
<br>
HDF5 originally provided a single indexed group structure,
referred to here as the original indexed implementation.
A new implementation of group structure, 
enabling several more advanced features,
-->
<br>
The original HDF5 group implementation provided 
a single indexed structure for link storage.
A new group implementation, in HDF5 Release 1.8.0,
enables more efficient compact storage for very small groups,
improved link indexing for large groups,
and other advanced features.
<ul>
    <li>The <i>original indexed</i> format remains the default.
        Links are stored in a B-tree in the group&rsquo;s local heap.
    <li>Groups created in the new <i>compact-or-indexed</i> format, 
        the implementation introduced with Release 1.8.0,
        can be tuned for performance, 
        switching between the compact and indexed formats 
        at thresholds set in the user application.
    <ul>
        <li>The <i>compact</i> format will conserve file space
            and processing overhead when working with small groups and 
            is particularly valuable when a group contains no links.
            Links are stored as a list of messages in the group&rsquo;s
            header.
        <li>The <i>indexed</i> format will yield improved performance
            when working with large groups, e.g., groups containing
            thousands to millions of members.
            Links are stored in a fractal heap and 
            indexed with an improved B-tree.
    </ul>
    <li>The new implementation also enables the use of link names 
        consisting of non-ASCII character sets 
        (see <a href="RM_H5P.html#Property-SetCharEncoding">
        <code>H5Pset_char_encoding</code></a>) 
        and is required for all link types other than hard or soft links,
        e.g., external and user-defined links
        (see the <a href="RM_H5L.html">H5L APIs</a>).
</ul>

<!--
<p>
The original group structure and the newer structures 
are not directly interoperable. 
HDF5 groups can be created in either of the two formats. 
Once created, a group in the original indexed format can be changed 
to a compact-or-indexed format if the need arises; 
there is no capability to change back.
As stated above, once in the compact-or-indexed format, 
a group can switch between compact and indexed as needed.

<p>
By default, a group will be created in the original indexed format.
Groups will be created in the compact-or-indexed format
under the following circumstances:

The original group structure and the newer structures 
are not directly interoperable. 
By default, a group will be created in the original indexed format.
An existing group can be changed to a compact-or-indexed format 
if the need arises; there is no capability to change back.
As stated above, once in the compact-or-indexed format, 
a group can switch between compact and indexed as needed.

<p>
Groups will be initially created in the compact-or-indexed format
only when one or more of the following conditions is met:
<ul>
    <li>The <i>low version bound</i> value of 
        the <i>library version bounds</i> property 
        has been set to Release 1.8.0 or later 
        in the file access property list
        (see <a href="RM_H5P.html#Property-SetLibverBounds">
        <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code></a>).
        Currently, that would require an <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code>
        call with the <em>low</em> parameter set to
        <code>H5F_LIBVER_LATEST</code>.
        <p>
        When this property is set for an HDF5 file, all objects in the file 
        will be created using the latest available format; no effort will
        be made to create a file that can be read by older libraries.
    <li>The creation order tracking property, 
        <code>H5P_CRT_ORDER_TRACKED</code>, has been set  
        in the group creation property list
        (see <a href="RM_H5P.html#Property-SetLinkCreationOrder">
        <code>H5Pset_link_creation_order</code></a>).
</ul>

<p>
<!--
The compact-or-indexed format also enables completely new capabilities:
user-defined and external links and non-ASCII link names.
-->
An existing group, currently in the original indexed format, 
will be converted to the compact-or-indexed format 
upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
<ul>
    <li>An external or user-defined link is inserted into the group.
    <li>A link named with a string composed of non-ASCII characters 
        is inserted into the group.

    <li>The <code>max_compact</code> and <code>min_dense</code>
        properties have been set in the group creation property list
        (see <a href="RM_H5P.html#Property-SetLinkPhaseChange">
        <code>H5Pset_link_phase_change</code></a>).

</ul>

<p>
The compact-or-indexed format offers performance improvements 
that will be most notable at the extremes, 
i.e., in groups with zero members 
and in groups with tens of thousands of members.  
But measurable differences may sometimes appear 
at a threshold as low as eight group members.
Since these performance thresholds and criteria differ from
application to application, tunable settings are provided to 
govern the switch between the compact and indexed formats
(see <a href="RM_H5P.html#Property-SetLinkPhaseChange">
<code>H5Pset_link_phase_change</code></a>).
Optimal thresholds will depend on the application and the 
operating environment.

<p>
Future versions of HDF5 will retain the ability to 
create, read, write, and manipulate 
all groups stored in either the original indexed format or
the compact-or-indexed format.
