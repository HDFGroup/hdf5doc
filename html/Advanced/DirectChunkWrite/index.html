<h1>Direct Chunk Write</h1>

<!--

When a user application is working with a chunked dataset and is writing 
a single chunk of data with <code>H5Dwrite</code>, the data goes through 
several steps inside the HDF5 library. 
The library first examines the hyperslab selection. 
Then it converts the data from the datatype in memory to the datatype in the 
file if they are different. Finally, the library processes the data in the 
filter pipeline. 
<p>
This can create an I/O bottleneck in a very high-throughput environment. 
<p>
The high-level C function <code>H5DOwrite_chunk</code> provides a mechanism
enabling the application to write a data chunk directly to the file 
bypassing the library&rsquo;s hyperslab selection, data conversion, and 
filter pipeline processes. 
If an application can pre-process the data properly, the application can 
use <code>H5DOwrite_chunk</code> to write the data much faster.
