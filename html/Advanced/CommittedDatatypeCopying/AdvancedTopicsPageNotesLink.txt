Committed Datatypes Copying, links to pdf from advanced topics



add the following to Advanced.html:

In the broadly applicable section, add this

left column:
Copying Committed Datatypes 
with H5Ocopy

right column:
Describes how to copy to another file a dataset that uses a committed 
datatype or an object with an attribute that uses a committed datatype 
so that the committed datatype in the destination file can be used by 
multiple objects.
(PDF only)

place the row above after the chunking row

the actual link for the Additional Resources page should be the following:
<a href="../Advanced/CommittedDatatypeCopying/CopyingCommittedDatatypesWithH5Ocopy.pdf">
Copying Committed Datatypes with H5Ocopy</a>

i think the info above can apply to add resources page too




link from datatypes chapter

This sentence is in section 6.8: 
    Note that a committed datatype can be shared by objects within the same 
    HDF5 file, but not by objects in other files. 

put the following after the sentence above as a link to the "Additional 
Resources" page:

    For more information on copying committed datatypes to other HDF5 
    files, see the &ldquo;Copying Committed Datatypes with H5Ocopy&rdquo; topic on 
    the &ldquo;<a href="17_Additional.html">Additional Resources</a>&rdquo; 
    chapter.
