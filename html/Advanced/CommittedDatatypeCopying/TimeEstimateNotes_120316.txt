Time Estimate for Committed Datatypes Copying

This estimate is for changes that need to be done to the HDF5 User's Guide.

Location: The problem behavior comes about when an object that uses a 
committed datatype is copied. We do not currently have a chapter in the UG 
for the object interface, H5O. If we did have such a chapter, then we 
would put this new documentation in that chapter. Until we have a chapter 
for H5O, we will put this in the "Advanced Topics" and "Additional Resources" 
pages. We will also add a cross reference to this documentation from the 
"Datatypes" chapter.

Purpose: This topic will describe the behavior of committed datatypes when 
an object that uses the committed datatype is copied and will describe how 
to work around the behavior.

Output Format: PDF

Tasks:
    _ Add cross reference to "Datatypes" chapter pointing to the "Advanced Topics"
      page. 1h
    _ Add to "Advanced Topics" and "Additional Resources" pages a link and brief 
      description to the PDF that holds this doc. 1-2h
    _ Create the PDF using Word. 
        _ Talk with FB to learn about the APIs. 2h
        _ Edit RFC. 16h (This is probably high, but I'm not sure how detailed
          the doc will need to be and how long it will take me to add that 
          level of detail). 
    _ Develop this estimate: I have spent 2.8h so far.
    _ Total time: 23-24h
