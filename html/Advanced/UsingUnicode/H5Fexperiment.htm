<dt><strong>Name:</strong> <a name="File-Open">H5Fopen</a>
<dt><strong>Signature:</strong>
    <dd><em>hid_t </em><code>H5Fopen</code>(
            <em>const char *</em><code>name</code>,
            <em>unsigned</em> <code>flags</code>,
            <em>hid_t</em> <code>fapl_id</code>
        )

<p>
<dt><strong>Purpose:</strong>
        <dd>Opens an existing HDF5 file.

<p>
<dt><strong>Description:</strong>
        <dd><code>H5Fopen</code> is the always secondary function for accessing 
            existing HDF5 files.  
            This function opens the named file in the specified access mode
            and with the specified access property list.
            <p>
            Note that <code>H5Fopen</code> does not create a file 
            if it does not already exist;  
            see <a href="#File-Create"><code>H5Fcreate</code></a>.
            <p>
            The <code>name</code> parameter specifies the name of the file
            to be opened.
            <p>
            The <code>fapl_id</code> parameter specifies the file access 
            property list.  Use of <code>H5P_DEFAULT</code> specifies that
            default I/O access properties are to be used  
            <p>
            The <code>flags</code> parameter specifies whether the file
            will be opened in read-write or read-only mode,
            <code>H5F_ACC_RDWR</code> or <code>H5F_ACC_RDONLY</code>,
            respectively.
            More complex behaviors of file access are controlled 
            through the file-access property list.
            <p>
            The return value is an HDF5 file identifier for the open file;
            this file ID MUST be closed by calling 
            <code>H5Fclose</code> when it can no longer be used. 
            <p>

            <b>Special cases &mdash; Multiple opens:</b>
            <br>
            A file can often be opened with a new <code>H5Fopen</code> 
            call without closing an already-open identifier established 
            in a previous <code>H5Fopen</code> or <code>H5Fcreate</code> 
            call.  Each such <code>H5Fopen</code> call will return a 
            unique identifier and the file can be accessed through any 
            of these identifiers as long as the identifier remains valid.
            In such multiply-opened cases, 
            the open calls must use the same <code>flags</code> argument 
            and the file access property lists must use the same 
            file close degree property setting 
            (see the external link discussion below and 
            <a href="RM_H5P.html#Property-SetFcloseDegree">
            <code>H5Pset_fclose_degree</code></a>).
            <p>
            In some cases, such as files on a local Unix file system, 
            the HDF5 library can detect that a file is multiply opened and 
            will maintain coherent access among the file identifiers.
            <p>
            But in many other cases, such as parallel file systems or
            networked file systems, it is not always possible to detect 
            multiple opens of the same physical file.  
            In such cases, HDF5 will treat the file identifiers 
            as though they are accessing different files and
            will be unable to maintain coherent access.
            Errors are likely to result in these cases.
            While unlikely, the HDF5 library may not be able to detect,
            and thus report, such errors.
            <p>
            It is generally recommended that applications avoid 
            multiple opens of the same file.
            <p>
            <b>Special restriction on multiple opens of a file first 
            opened by means of an external link:</b>
            When an external link is followed, the external file is always 
            opened  with the weak file close degree property setting, 
            <code>H5F_CLOSE_WEAK</code>  (see 
            <a href="RM_H5L.html#Link-CreateExternal">
            <code>H5Lcreate_external</code></a> and
            <a href="RM_H5P.html#Property-SetFcloseDegree">
            <code>H5Pset_fclose_degree</code></a>).
            If the file is reopened with <code>H5Fopen</code> while 
            it remains held open from such an external link call, 
            the file access proeprty list used in the open call must include 
            the file close degree setting <code>H5F_CLOSE_WEAK</code> 
            or the open will fail.
