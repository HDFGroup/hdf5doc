<h1>Using UTF-8 Encoding in HDF5 Applications</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <dir>

    Text and character data are often discussed as though 
    <i>text</i> means <i>ASCII text</i>.  We even go so far 
    as to call a file containing only ASCII text a <i>plain text</i> file.
    This works reasonably well for English (though better for 
    American English than British English),
    but what if that plain text file is in French, German, Chinese,
    or any of several hundred other languages?
    This document introduces the use of UTF-8 encoding 
    (see <a href="#UTF8_Note1">note 1</a>), 
    enabling the use of a much more extensive and flexible character set 
    that can faithfully represent any of those languages.

    <p>
    This document assumes a working familiarity with UTF-8 and Unicode.  
    Any reader who is unfamiliar with UTF-8 encoding should read the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">Wikipedia UTF-8 article</a>
    (<code>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8</code>) 
    before proceeding; it provides an excellent primer.  
    <p>
    For our context, the most important UTF-8 concepts are:
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-byte and variable-size character encodings 
      <li>Limitations of the ASCII character set 
      <li>Risks associated with the use of the term <i>plain text</i>
      <li>Representation of multiple language alphabets or characters 
          in a single document 
    </ul>
    <p>
    More specific technical details will only become important if they
    affect the specifics of your application design or implementation.
    </dir>


    <p>
<h2>How and Where Is UTF-8 Supported in HDF5?</h2>
    <dir>

    HDF5 uses characters in object names (which are actually link names, 
    but that&rsquo;s a story for a different article), dataset raw data,
    attribute names, and attribute raw data.  
    Though the mechanisms differ, you can use either 
    ASCII or UTF-8 character sets in all of these situations.

    <h3>Object and Attribute Names</h3>
    By default, HDF5 creates object and attribute names with ASCII character 
    encoding.  An object or attribute creation property list setting is 
    required to create object names with UTF-8 characters.
    This uses the function <code>H5Pset_char_encoding</code>,
    which sets the character encoding used for object and attribute names.
    <p>
    For example, the following call sequence could be used to create a dataset 
    with its name encoded with the UTF-8 character set:
    <pre>
    lcpl_id =    H5Pcreate(H5P_LINK_CREATE) ;
    error =      H5Pset_char_encoding(lcpl_id, H5T_CSET_UTF8) ;
    dataset_id = H5Dcreate2(group_id, "datos_&ntilde;", datatype_id, dataspace_id, 
                 lcpl_id, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT) ;               </pre>
    <p>
    If the character encoding of an object or attribute name is unknown,
    the combination of an <code>H5A/H5D/H5G/H5Tget_create_plist</code> call
    (that is, <code>H5Aget_create_plist</code>, <code>H5Dget_create_plist</code>,
    etc., as appropriate)
    and an <code>H5Pget_char_encoding</code> call will reveal that 
    information.

    <h3>Character Datatypes in Datasets and Attributes</h3>
    Like object names, HDF5 character data in datasets and attributes
    is encoded as ASCII by default.
    Setting up attribute or dataset character data to be UTF-8-encoded is 
    accomplished while defining the attribute or dataset datatype.
    This makes use of the function <code>H5Tset_cset</code>,
    which sets the character encoding to be used in building a character 
    datatype.
    <p>
    For example, the following commands could be used to create an
    8-character, UTF-8 encoded, string datatype for use in either 
    an attribute or dataset:
    <pre>
    datatype_id = H5Tcopy(H5T_C_S1) ;
    error =       H5Tset_cset(datatype_id, H5T_CSET_UTF8) ;
    error =       H5Tset_size(datatype_id, "8") ;                   </pre>
    <p>
    If a character or string datatype&rsquo;s character encoding is unknown,
    the combination of an <code>H5Aget_type</code> or <code>H5Dget_type</code> 
    call and an <code>H5Tget_cset</code> call can be used to determine that.
    </dir>


    <p>
<h2>Caveats, Pitfalls, and Things to Watch For</h2>
    <dir>
    Programmers who are accustomed to using ASCII text without accommodating 
    other text encodings will have to be aware of certain common issues as 
    they begin using UTF-8 encodings.
    </dir>
    <dir>

    <h3>Cross-platform Portability</h3>
        Since the HDF5 Library handles datatypes directly,
        UTF-8 encoded text in dataset and attribute datatypes in a 
        well-designed HDF5 application and file should work transparently 
        across platforms.  
        The same should be true of handling names of groups, datasets, 
        committed datatypes, and attributes within a file.
        <p>
        Be aware, however, of system or application limitations 
        once data or other information has been extracted from an HDF5 file.
        The application or system must be designed to accommodate 
        UTF-8 encodings if the information is then used elsewhere in the 
        application or system environment. 
        <p>
        Data from a UTF-8 encoded HDF5 datatype, in either a dataset or an 
        attribute, that has been established within an HDF5 application 
        should &ldquo;just work&rdquo; within the HDF5 portions of the 
        application.
    </dir>
    <dir>

    <h3>Filenames</h3>
        Since file access is a system issue, filenames do not fall within 
        the scope of HDF5&rsquo;s UTF-8 capabilities; 
        filenames are encoded at the system level.
        <p>
        Linux and Mac OS systems normally handle UTF-8 encoded filenames
        correctly while Windows systems generally do not.
    </dir>
    <dir>

    <h3>The <i>Plain Text</i> Illusion</h3>
        Beware the use of the term <i>plain text</i>.  
        <i>Plain text</i> is at best ambiguous, but often misleading.  
        Many will assume that <i>plain text</i> means ASCII, 
        but plain text German or French, for example, 
        cannot be represented in ASCII.
        Plain text is only unambiguous in the context of English (and even 
        then can be problematic!).
    </dir>
    <dir>

    <h3>Storage Size</h3>
        Programmers and data users accustomed to working strictly with
        ASCII data generally make the reasonable assumption that 1 character, 
        be it in an object name or in data, requires 1 byte of storage.  
        This equation does not work when using UTF-8 or any other Unicode 
        encoding.
        With Unicode encoding, <i>number of characters</i> 
        is not synonymous with <i>number of bytes</i>.  
        One must get used to thinking in terms of <i>number of characters</i> 
        when talking about content, reserving <i>number of bytes</i> 
        for discussions of storage size.
        <p>
        When working with Unicode text, one can no longer assume 
        a 1:1 correspondence between the number of characters and 
        the data storage requirement.
    </dir>
    <dir>

    <p>
    <h3>System Dependencies</h3>
        <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>Unix</strong>, and similar systems
        generally handle UTF-8 encodings in correct and predictable ways.
        There is an apparent consensus in the Linux community that
        &ldquo;UTF-8 is just the right way to go.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Mac OS</strong> systems generally handle UTF-8 encodings
        correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Windows</strong> systems use a different Unicode encoding, 
        UCS-2 (discussed in this 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a> article)
        at the system level.  
        Within an HDF5 file and application on a Windows system, 
        UTF-8 encoding should work correctly and as expected.
        Problems may arise, however, when that UTF-8 encoding is exposed 
        directly to the Windows system.  For example:
        <ul>
            <li>File open and close calls on files with UTF-8 encoded names
                are likely to fail as the HDF5 open and close operations 
                interact directly with the Windows file system interface.
            <li>Anytime an HDF5 command-line utility (<code>h5ls</code>
                or <code>h5dump</code>, for example) emits text output,
                the Windows system must interpret the character encodings.
                If that output is UTF-8 encoded, Windows will correctly 
                interpret only those characters in the ASCII subset of UTF-8.  
        </ul>
        </p>
    </dir>


    <p>
<h2>Common Characters in UTF-8 and ASCII</h2>
    <dir>
        One interesting feature of UTF-8 and ASCII is that the ASCII
        character set is a discrete subset of the UTF-8 character set.
        And where they overlap, the encodings are identical.
        This means that a character string consisting entirely of
        members of the ASCII character set 
        can be encoded in either ASCII or UTF-8,
        the two encodings will be indistinguishable, and 
        the encodings will require exactly the same storage space.
