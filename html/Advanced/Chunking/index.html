<h1>Chunking in HDF5</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

    Datasets in HDF5 not only provide a convenient, structured, and 
    self-describing way to store data, but are also designed to do so with 
    good performance. In order to maximize performance, the HDF5 library 
    provides ways to specify how the data is stored on disk, 
    how it is accessed, and how it should be held in memory.

<h2>What are Chunks?</h2>

  Datasets in HDF5 can represent arrays with any number of dimensions (up to 32). 
  However, in the file this dataset must be stored as part of the 1-dimensional 
  stream of data that is the low-level file. The way in which the multidimensional 
  dataset is mapped to the serial file is called the layout. The most obvious way to 
  accomplish this is to simply flatten the dataset in a way similar to how arrays are 
  stored in memory, serializing the entire dataset into a monolithic block on disk, 
  which maps directly to a memory buffer the size of the dataset. This is called a 
  contiguous layout.
  <p>
  An alternative to the contiguous layout is the chunked layout. Whereas contiguous 
  datasets are stored in a single block in the file, chunked datasets are split into 
  multiple <em>chunks</em> which are all stored separately in the file. The chunks can be 
  stored in any order and any position within the HDF5 file. Chunks can then be read 
  and written individually, improving performance when operating on a subset of the 
  dataset. 
  <p>
  The API functions used to read and write chunked datasets are exactly the same 
  functions used to read and write contiguous datasets. The only difference is a 
  single call to set up the layout on a property list before the dataset is created. 
  In this way, a program can switch between using chunked and contiguous datasets by 
  simply altering that call. Example 1, below, creates a dataset with a size of 12x12 
  and a chunk size of 4x4. The example could be change to create a contiguous dataset 
  instead by simply commenting out the call to <code>H5Pset_chunk</code>.

  <dir><pre>
  <example>
#include <hdf5.h>
int main(void) {
	hid_t		file_id, dset_id, space_id, dcpl_id;
	hsize_t	chunk_dims[2] = {4, 4};
	hsize_t	dset_dims[2] = {12, 12};
	int		buffer[12][12];

	/* Create the file */
	file_id = H5Fcreate(<em>file.h5</em>, H5F_ACC_TRUNC, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);

	/* Create a dataset creation property list and set it to use chunking
	 */
	dcpl_id = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATASET_CREATE);
	H5Pset_chunk(dcpl_id, 2, chunk_dims);

	/* Create the dataspace and the chunked dataset */
	space_id = H5Screate_simple(2, dset_dims, NULL);
	dset_id = H5Dcreate(file, <em>dataset</em>, H5T_NATIVE_INT, space_id, dcpl_id, 
H5P_DEFAULT);

	/* Write to the dataset */
	buffer = <initialize buffer>
	H5Dwrite(dset_id, H5T_NATIVE_INT, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, buffer);

	/* Close */
	H5Dclose(dset_id);
	H5Sclose(space_id);
	H5Pclose(dcpl_id);
	H5Fclose(file_id);
	return 0;
}

  <p>
  The chunks of a chunked dataset are split along logical boundaries in the dataset's 
  representation as an array, not along boundaries in the serialized form. Suppose a 
  dataset has a chunk size of 2x2. In this case, the first chunk would go from (0,0) 
  to (2,2), the second from (0,2) to (2,4), and so on. By selecting the chunk size 
  carefully, it is possible to fine tune I/O to maximize performance for any access 
  pattern. Chunking is also required to use advanced features such as compression and 
  dataset resizing.

    </div>


<h2>Data Storage Order</h2>

  To understand the effects of chunking on I/O performance it is necessary to 
  understand the order in which data is actually stored on disk.  When using the C 
  interface, data elements are stored in "row-major" order, meaning that, for a 2-
  dimensional dataset, rows of data are stored in-order on the disk. This is 
  equivalent to the storage order of C arrays in memory.
  <p>
  Suppose we have a 10x10 contiguous dataset B. The first element stored on disk is 
  B[0][0], the second B[0][1], the eleventh B[1][0], and so on. If we want to read 
  the elements from B[2][3] to B[2][7], we have to read the elements in the 24th, 
  25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th positions. Since all of these positions are contiguous, or 
  next to each other, this can be done in a single read operation: read 5 elements 
  starting at the 24th position. This operation is illustrated in figure 3: the pink 
  cells represent elements to be read and the solid line represents a read operation.
  Now suppose we want to read the elements in the column from B[3][2] to B[7][2].  In 
  this case we must read the elements in the 33rd, 43rd, 53rd, 63rd, and 73rd positions. 
  Since these positions are not contiguous, this must be done in 5 separate read 
  operations. This operation is illustrated in figure 4: the solid lines again 
  represent read operations, and the dotted lines represent seek operations. An 
  alternative would be to perform a single large read operation , in this case 41 
  elements starting at the 33rd position. This is called a <em>sieve buffer</em> and is 
  supported by HDF5 for contiguous datasets, but not for chunked datasets. By setting 
  the chunk sizes correctly, it is possible to greatly exceed the performance of the 
  sieve buffer scheme.

            </td></tr>
    </table>

    </div>

  <p>
  Likewise, in higher dimensions, the last dimension specified is the fastest 
  changing on disk. So if we have a four dimensional dataset A, then the first 
  element on disk would be A[0][0][0][0], the second A[0][0][0][1], the third 
  A[0][0][0][2], and so on.

<h2>Chunking and Partial I/O</h2>

  The issues outlined above regarding data storage order help to illustrate one of 
  the major benefits of dataset chunking, its ability to improve the performance of 
  partial I/O. Partial I/O is an I/O operation (read or write) which operates on only 
  one part of the dataset. To maximize the performance of partial I/O, the data 
  elements selected for I/O must be contiguous on disk. As we saw above, with a 
  contiguous dataset, this means that the selection must always equal the extent in 
  all but the slowest changing dimension, unless the selection in the slowest 
  changing dimension is a single element. With a 2-d dataset in C, this means that 
  the selection must be as wide as the entire dataset unless only a single row is 
  selected. With a 3-d dataset, this means that the selection must be as wide and as 
  deep as the entire dataset, unless only a single row is selected, in which case it 
  must still be as deep as the entire dataset, unless only a single column is also 
  selected.
  <p>
  Chunking allows the user to modify the conditions for maximum performance by 
  changing the regions in the dataset which are contiguous. For example, reading a 
  20x20 selection in a contiguous dataset with a width greater than 20 would require 
  20 separate and non-contiguous read operations. If the same operation were 
  performed on a dataset that was created with a chunk size of 20x20, the operation 
  would require only a single read operation. In general, if your selections are 
  always the same size (or multiples of the same size), and start at multiples of 
  that size, then the chunk size should be set to the selection size, or an integer 
  divisor of it. This recommendation is subject to the guidelines in the <em>pitfalls</em> 
  section; specifically, it should not be too small or too large.
  <p>
  Using this strategy, we can greatly improve the performance of the operation shown 
  in figure 4. If we create the dataset with a chunk size of 10x1, each column of the 
  dataset will be stored separately and contiguously. The read of a partial column 
  can then be done is a single operation. This is illustrated in figure 5, and the 
  code to implement a similar operation is shown in example 2. For simplicity, 
  example 2 implements writing to this dataset instead of reading from it.

<h2>Chunk Caching</h2>

  Another major feature of the dataset chunking scheme is the chunk cache.  As it 
  sounds, this is a cache of the chunks in the dataset. This cache can greatly 
  improve performance whenever the same chunks are read from or written to multiple 
  times, by preventing the library from having to read from and write to disk 
  multiple times. However, the current implementation of the chunk cache does not 
  adjust its parameters automatically, and therefore the parameters must be adjusted 
  manually to achieve optimal performance. In some rare cases it may be best to 
  completely disable the chunk caching scheme. Each open dataset has its own chunk 
  cache, which is separate from the caches for all other open datasets.
  <p>
  When a selection is read from a chunked dataset, the chunks containing the 
  selection are first read into the cache, and then the selected parts of those 
  chunks are copied into the user's buffer. The cached chunks stay in the cache until 
  they are evicted, which typically occurs because more space is needed in the cache 
  for new chunks, but they can also be evicted if hash values collide (more on this 
  later). Once the chunk is evicted it is written to disk if necessary and freed from 
  memory.
  <p>
  This process is illustrated in figures 6 and 7. In figure 6, the application 
  requests a row of values, and the library responds by bringing the chunks 
  containing that row into cache, and retrieving the values from cache. In figure 7, 
  the application requests a different row that is covered by the same chunks, and 
  the library retrieves the values directly from cache without touching the disk.

            and a row of a chunked dataset with the chunks already in the cache">
            </td></td>
        <tr><td align="left" valign="top">
            <b>Figure 7:</b> Reading a row from a chunked dataset
            with the chunks already cached
            </td></tr>
    </table>

    </div>

  <p>
  In order to allow the chunks to be looked up quickly in cache, each chunk is 
  assigned a unique hash value that is used to look up the chunk. The cache contains 
  a simple array of pointers to chunks, which is called a hash table. A chunk's hash 
  value is simply the index into the hash table of the pointer to that chunk. While 
  the pointer at this location might instead point to a different chunk or to nothing 
  at all, no other locations in the hash table can contain a pointer to the chunk in 
  question. Therefore, the library only has to check this one location in the hash 
  table to tell if a chunk is in cache or not. This also means that if two or more 
  chunks share the same hash value, then only one of those chunks can be in the cache 
  at the same time. When a chunk is brought into cache and another chunk with the 
  same hash value is already in cache, the second chunk must be evicted first. 
  Therefore it is very important to make sure that the size of the hash table, also 
  called the nslots parameter in <code>H5Pset_cache</code> and <code>H5Pset_chunk_cache</code>, is large enough 
  to minimize the number of hash value collisions.
  <p>
  To determine the hash value for a chunk, the chunk is first assigned a unique index 
  that is the linear index into a hypothetical array of the chunks. That is, the 
  upper-left chunk has an index of 0, the one to the right of that has an index of 1, 
  and so on. This index is then divided by the size of the hash table, nslots, and 
  the remainder, or modulus, is the hash value. Because this scheme can result in 
  regularly spaced indices being used frequently, it is important that nslots be a 
  prime number to minimize the chance of collisions. In general, nslots should 
  probably be set to a number approximately 100 times the number of chunks that can 
  fit in nbytes bytes, unless memory is extremely limited. There is of course no 
  advantage in setting nslots to a number larger than the total number of chunks in 
  the dataset.
  <p>
  The w0 parameter affects how the library decides which chunk to evict when it needs 
  room in the cache. If w0 is set to 0, then the library will always evict the least 
  recently used chunk in cache. If w0 is set to 1, the library will always evict the 
  least recently used chunk which has been fully read or written, and if none have 
  been fully read or written, it will evict the least recently used chunk. If w0 is 
  between 0 and 1, the behaviour will be a blend of the two. Therefore, if the 
  application will access the same data more than once, w0 should be set closer to 0, 
  and if the application does not, w0 should be set closer to 1.
  <p>
  It is important to remember that chunk caching will only give a benefit when 
  reading or writing the same chunk more than once. If, for example, an application 
  is reading an entire dataset, with only whole chunks selected for each operation, 
  then chunk caching will not help performance, and it may be preferable to 
  completely disable the chunk cache in order to save memory. It may also be 
  advantageous to disable the chunk cache when writing small amounts to many 
  different chunks, if memory is not large enough to hold all those chunks in cache 
  at once.

<h2>I/O Filters and Compression</h2>

  Dataset chunking also enables the use of I/O filters, including compression.  The 
  filters are applied to each chunk individually, and the entire chunk is processed 
  at once. The filter must be applied every time the chunk is loaded into cache, and 
  every time the chunk is flushed to disk. These facts all make choosing the proper 
  settings for the chunk cache and chunk size even more critical for the performance 
  of filtered datasets.
  <p>
  Because the entire chunk must be filtered every time disk I/O occurs, it is no 
  longer a viable option to disable the chunk cache when writing small amounts of 
  data to many different chunks. To achieve acceptable performance, it is critical to 
  minimize the chance that a chunk will be flushed from cache before it is completely 
  read or written. This can be done by increasing the size of the chunk cache, 
  adjusting the size of the chunks, or adjusting I/O patterns.

<h2>Pitfalls</h2>

  Inappropriate chunk size and cache settings can dramatically reduce performance. 
  There are a number of ways this can happen. Some of the more common issues include:

  <ul>
      <li>Chunks are too small
          <p>
          There is a certain amount of overhead associated with finding chunks. When chunks 
          are made smaller, there are more of them in the dataset. When performing I/O on a 
          dataset, if there are many chunks in the selection, it will take extra time to look 
          up each chunk. In addition, since the chunks are stored independently, more chunks 
          results in more I/O operations, further compounding the issue. The extra metadata 
          needed to locate the chunks also causes the file size to increase as chunks are 
          made smaller. Making chunks larger results in fewer chunk lookups, smaller file 
          size, and fewer I/O operations in most cases.
      <li>Chunks are too large
          <p>
          It may be tempting to simply set the chunk size to be the same as the dataset size 
          in order to enable compression on a <em>contiguous</em> dataset. However, this can have 
          unintended consequences. Because the entire chunk must be read from disk and 
          decompressed before performing any operations, this will impose a great performance 
          penalty when operating on a small subset of the dataset if the cache is not large 
          enough to hold the one-chunk dataset. In addition, if the dataset is large enough, 
          since the entire chunk must be held in memory while compressing and decompressing, 
          the operation could cause the operating system to page memory to disk, slowing down 
          the entire system.
      <li>Cache is not big enough
          <p>
          Similarly, if the chunk cache is not set to a large enough size for the chunk size 
          and access pattern, poor performance will result. In general, the chunk cache 
          should be large enough to fit all of the chunks that contain part of a hyperslab 
          selection used to read or write. When the chunk cache is not large enough, all of 
          the chunks in the selection will be read into cache and then written to disk (if 
          writing) and evicted. If the application then revisits the same chunks, they will 
          have to be read and possibly written again, whereas if the cache were large enough 
          they would only have to be read (and possibly written) once. However, if selections 
          for I/O always coincide with chunk boundaries, this does not matter as much, as 
          there is no wasted I/O and the application is unlikely to revisit the same chunks 
          soon after.
          <p>
          If the total size of the chunks involved in a selection is too big to practically 
          fit into memory, and neither the chunk nor the selection can be resized or 
          reshaped, it may be better to disable the chunk cache. Whether this is better 
          depends on the storage order of the selected elements. It will also make little 
          difference if the dataset is filtered, as entire chunks must be brought into memory 
          anyways in that case. When the chunk cache is disabled and there are no filters, 
          all I/O is done directly to and from the disk. If the selection is mostly along the 
          fastest changing dimension (i.e. rows), then the data will be more contiguous on 
          disk, and direct I/O will be more efficient than reading entire chunks, and hence 
          the cache should be disabled. If however the selection is mostly along the slowest 
          changing dimension (columns), then the data will not be contiguous on disk, and 
          direct I/O will involve a large number of small operations, and it will probably be 
          more efficient to just operate on the entire chunk, therefore the cache should be 
          set large enough to hold at least 1 chunk. To disable the chunk cache, either 
          nbytes or nslots should be set to 0.
      <li>Improper hash table size
          <p>
          Because only one chunk can be present in each slot of the hash table, it is 
          possible for an improperly set hash table size (nslots) to severely impact 
          performance. For example, if there are 100 columns of chunks in a dataset, and the 
          hash table size is set to 100, then all the chunks in each row will have the same 
          hash value. Attempting to access a row of elements will result in each chunk being 
          brought into cache and then evicted to allow the next one to occupy its slot in the 
          hash table, even if the chunk cache is large enough, in terms of nbytes, to hold 
          all of them. Similar situations can arise when nslots is a factor or multiple of 
          the number of rows of chunks, or equivalent situations in higher dimensions.
          <p>
          Luckily, because each slot in the hash table only occupies the size of the pointer 
          for the system, usually 4 or 8 bytes, there is little reason to keep nslots small. 
          Again, a general rule is that nslots should be set to a prime number at least 100 
          times the number of chunks that can fit in nbytes, or simply set to the number of 
          chunks in the dataset.

    The slide set &ldquo;<a href="Chunking_Tutorial_EOS13_2009.pdf">HDF5 
    Advanced Topics: Chunking in HDF5</a>&rdquo; (PDF), a turotial from 
    HDF and HDF-EOS Workshop XIII (2009) provides additional HDF5 chunking 
    use cases and examples.

    <p>
    The page 
    &ldquo;<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/examples-by-api/api18-c.html">HDF5 
    Examples by API</a>&rdquo; lists many code examples that are regularly 
    tested with the HDF5 Library.  Several illustrate the use of chunking 
    in HDF5, particularly &ldquo;Read/Write Chunked Dataset&rdquo; and 
    any examples demonstrating filters. 

    <p>
    &ldquo;<a href="../../H5.user/Chunking.html">Dataset Chunking Issues</a>&rdquo;
    provides additional information regarding chunking that has not yet been
    incorporated into this document.  


<h2>Directions for Future Development</h2>

  As seen above, the HDF5 chunk cache currently requires careful control of the 
  parameters in order to achieve optimal performance. In the future, we plan to 
  improve the chunk cache to be more foolproof in many ways, and deliver acceptable 
  performance in most cases even when no thought is given to the chunking parameters.
  <p>
  One way to make the chunk cache more user-friendly is to automatically resize the 
  chunk cache as needed for each operation. The cache should be able to detect when 
  the cache should be skipped or when it needs to be enlarged based on the pattern of 
  I/O operations. At a minimum, it should be able to detect when the cache would 
  severely hurt performance for a single operation and disable the cache for that 
  operation. This would of course be optional.
  <p>
  Another way is to allow chaining of entries in the hash table. This would make the 
  hash table size much less of an issue, as chunks could shared the same hash value 
  by making a linked list.
  <p>
  Finally, it may even be desirable to set some reasonable default chunk size based 
  on the dataset size and possibly some other information on the intended access 
  pattern. This would probably be a high-level routine.
  <p>
  Other features planned for chunking include new index methods (besides b-trees), 
  disabling filters for chunks that are partially over the edge of a dataset, only 
  storing the used portions of these edge chunks, and allowing multiple reader 
  processes to read the same dataset as a single writer process writes to it.
