<h1>Dynamic Plugins in HDF5
<br />
<font size="4">Including Dynamically Loaded Filters</font>
</h1>

    <dir>
    HDF5 provides the capability to employ dynamic plugins.
    The first application of dynamic plugins was dynamically loaded filters.
    <p />
    The deployment of dynamic plugins can be managed in the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Through the setting of an environment variable 
        <li>Programmatically from within an application 
    </ul>
    
    
    <p />&nbsp;
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p />
    Guides to the design and use of dynamic plugins and
    dynamically loaded filters in HDF5:

    href="Design-HDF5-Programmatic_Control_of_Dynamic_Plugins.pdf">Programmatic
    Control of Dynamic Plugins</a>&rdquo; 
    </dir>
    <p />
    HDF5 functions for programmatic control of dynamic plugins and
    dynamically loaded filters from within an HDF5 application:
