<h1>Using Identifiers</h1>

  <p>The purpose of this topic is to describe how identifiers behave 
  and how they should be treated by application programs.</p>

  <p>When an application program uses the HDF5 library to create or 
  open an item, a unique identifier is returned. The items that return 
  a unique identifier when they are created or opened include the 
  following: dataset, group, datatype, dataspace, file, attribute, 
  property list, referenced object, error stack, and error message.</p>

  <p>An application may open one of the items listed above more than 
  once at the same time. For example, an application might open a group 
  twice, receiving two identifiers. Information from one dataset in the 
  group could be handled through one identifier, and the information 
  from another dataset in the group is handled by a different identifier.</p>

  <p>An application program should track every identifier it receives 
  as a result of creating or opening one of the items listed above. In 
  order for an application to close properly, it must release every 
  identifier it has opened. If an application opened a group twice for 
  example, it would need to issue two <code>H5Gclose</code> commands, 
  one for each identifier. Not releasing identifiers causes resource 
  leaks. Until an identifier is released, the item associated with 
  the identifier is still open.</p>

  <p>The library considers a file open until all of the identifiers 
  associated with the file and with the file’s various items have been 
  released. The identifiers associated with these open items must be 
  released separately. This means that an application can close a file 
  and still work with one or more portions of the file. Suppose an 
  application opened a file, a group within the file, and two datasets 
  within the group. If the application closed the file with 
  <code>H5Fclose</code>, 
then the file would be considered closed to the application, but the 
group and two datasets would still be open.</p>

<p>There are several exceptions to the above file closing rule. One 
is when the <code>H5close</code> function is used instead of <code>H5Fclose</code>. 
<code>H5close</code> 
causes a general shutdown of the library: all data is written to disk, 
all identifiers are closed, and all memory used by the library is 
cleaned up. Another exception occurs on parallel processing systems. 
Suppose on a parallel system an application has opened a file, a group 
in the file, and two datasets in the group. If the application uses 
the <code>H5Fclose</code> function to close the file, the call will fail with an 
error. The open group and datasets must be closed before the file can 
be closed. A third exception is when the file access property list 
includes the property <code>H5F_CLOSE_STRONG</code>. This property causes the closing 
of all of the file’s open items when the file is closed with <code>H5Fclose</code>.</p>

<p>For more information about <code>H5close</code>, <code>H5Fclose</code>, 
and <code>H5Pset_fclose_degree</code>,
