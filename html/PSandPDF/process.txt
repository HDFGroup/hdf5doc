PDF versions of the HDF5 Reference Manual (RM) and the new HDF5 User's Guide 
(UG) are created from the HTML source at each release of the HDF5 Library.  
The process is managed through two application environments, Macromedia 
DreamWeaver (an HTML editing environment) and HTML doc (a conversion tool).  
This document describes the process in detail for the RM; the process for the 
UG is very similar and will be described in a subsequent update.


The HDF5 Reference Manual
-------------------------
1.  Using Macromedia Dreamweaver, define a site that contains all the 
    documents within doc/html, including html, image, DreamWeaver library and 
    .book files.

2.  In the ed_libs directory:

      a) Assuming you have your libraries set up for electronic viewing (to
         verify, check that there is nothing more than a commented note and
         an '&nbsp;' in the 3 aforementioned _Null libraries) drop the code
         from the actual library into it's respective Null lib, replacing 
         the &nbsp;.
           (EXAMPLE: Take all the code from Footer.lbi and insert it into
            Footer_Null.lbi, taking care not to remove the commented note.)
     
      b) In the now empty library file, add an &nbsp;.
      
      c) Save the libraries and thier respective Null files.

      d) With a library still open (not a Null one) choose 
          Modify>Library>Update Pages...
         Look in: Entire Site
         Check 'Library Items' in the 'Update:' selection.
         Hit start.

3.  In RM_H5P.html:

      a) RM_H5P.html contains two versions of the 'C Interfaces' function 
         list.  One is for print use and one is for electronic use.  
         One should be visible and one should be commented out.  
         Make sure that the section labelled with 
         <!-- FOR USE WITH ELECTRONIC VERSION ---> is commented out.
         (by removing the >s).
 

4.  Using HTMLdoc:  
      
      a) Open PDF_RM_body.book 
      
      b) The Input tab:
           Document Type: Web Page
           Input Files:
             RM_H5Front.html
             RM_H5.html

             RM_H5D.html
             RM_H5E.html
             RM_H5F.html
             RM_H5G.html
             RM_H5I.html

             Glossary.html
           Logo Image: none
           Title File/Image: none

      c) The Output tab:
           Output To: File
           Output Path: H5_RM_body.pdf
           Output Format: PDF
           Output Options: JPEG Big Images
           Compression (not critical, change at will): Slider right above 'Fast'
           JPEG Quality (not critical, change at will): 60
  
      d) The Page tab:
           Page Size: Letter, 2-Sided
             Top: 0.50in, Left: 1.00in, Right: 0.50in, Bottom: 0.50in
           Header: Blank, Blank, Blank
           Footer: Blank, Blank, 1,2,3,...
           Number Up: 1

      e) The Colors tab:
           Everything Blank
           Link Style: Plain
    
      f) The Fonts tab:
           Base Font Size: 11.0
           Line Spacing: 1.2
           Body Typeface: Times
           Heading Typeface: Helvetica
           Header/Footer Size: 10.0
           Header/Footer Font: Helvetica
           Character Set: iso-8859-1
           Options: Do Not Check 'Embed Fonts'

      g) The PDF tab:
           PDF Version: 1.3
           Page Mode: Document
           Page Layout: Single
           Page Effect: None
           Options: Check 'Include Links'

      h) The Security tab:
           Encryption: No

      i) The Options tab:
           HTML Editor: Point to Dreamweaver (recommended)
           Browser Width: 680
           GUI Option: Check all 3

      j) Save the book file.
     
      k) Verify that the output file (H5_RM_body.pdf) is not open.

      l) Generate the document.

5.  Open H5_RM_body.pdf
    
      a) Scan through the document page by page to verify that there are no 
         elements that should have been eliminated via javascripts or swapped 
         library contents.

      b) Scan through again looking only for places where page breaks need to 
         be added, removed, or relocated.  I have found that re-generating the 
         document after every pagination correction actually saves time in the 
         long run.  This is because some pagination corrections that must be 
         made may create other problems further down in the document.  
         Re-generating the document ensures that every problem you focus on 
         won't have to be re-done.

      c) When you are sure all the pagination is correct (don't forget to 
         start each of the sections included in the Table of Contents on a 
         recto) note page numbers for the beginning of each section in the TOC.

6.  Open RM_TOC.html

      a) Edit page numbers accordingly. 
         (Note: Assuming the general format of RM_H5Front remains the same, 
          the 'Overview' listing in the TOC should always be on pg. 1, and 
          the 'Fortran90 and C++ APIs' listing should be on pg. 2, an 
          exepction to the recto-rule.)

      b) Save.

7.  Using HTMLdoc:

      a) Open PDF_RM_front.book

      b) The Input tab:
