Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.1 Release
==================================
    * Fixed bug with non-zero userblock sizes causing raw data to not
      write correctly.
    * Fixed problems with Pablo build and linking with non-standard MPI I/O.
    * Fixed build on Linux systems with --enable-static-exec flag. It now
      works correctly.
    * IMPORTANT: Fixed file metadata corruption bug which could cause metadata
      data loss in certain situations.

Supported Configuration Features Summary
========================================

    * See "Supported Configuration Features Summary" section for the HDF5
      1.4.0 release in the HISTORY.txt file.

Known Problems
==============

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output in some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executable are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * The shared library failed compilation on IRIX 6.5.
    
    * After "make install" or "make install-doc" one may need to reload
      the source from the tar file before doing another build.

    * See "Known problems" section for the HDF5 1.4.0 release in the
      HISTORY.txt file.
