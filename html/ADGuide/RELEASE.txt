New Features
============

    * File sizes greater than 2GB are now supported on Linux systems with
      version 2.4.x or higher kernels.
    * Added a global string variable H5_lib_vers_info_g which holds the
      HDF5 library version information.  This can be used to identify
      an hdf5 library or hdf5 application binary.
      Also added a verification of the consistency between H5_lib_vers_info_g
      and other version information in the source code.
    * Parallel HDF5 now runs on the HP V2500 and HP N4000 machines.
    * F90 API:
        - Added aditional parameter "dims" to the h5dread/h5dwrite and
          h5aread/h5awrite subroutines. This parameter is 1D array of size
          7 and contains the sizes of the data buffer dimensions. 
    * F90 static library is available on Windows platforms. See
      INSTALL_Windows.txt for details.
    * F90 APIs are available on HPUX 11.00 and IBM SP platforms.
    * H5 <-> GIF convertor has been added. This is available under 
      tools/gifconv. The convertor supports the ability to create animated
      gifs as well.
    * Verified correct operation of library on Solaris 2.8 in both 64-bit and
      32-bit compilation modes.  See INSTALL document for instructions on
      compiling the distribution with 64-bit support.
    * Added support for the Metrowerks Code Warrior compiler for Windows.       
         
Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.1 Release
==================================

    * Fixed bug with non-zero userblock sizes causing raw data to not
      write correctly.
    * Fixed problems with Pablo build and linking with non-standard MPI I/O.
    * Fixed build on Linux systems with --enable-static-exec flag. It now
      works correctly.
    * IMPORTANT: Fixed file metadata corruption bug which could cause metadata
      data loss in certain situations.
    * The allocation by alignment (H5Pset_alignment) feature code somehow
      got dropped in some 1.3.x version. Re-implemented it with "new and
      improved" algorithm.  It keeps track of "wasted" file-fragment in
      the free-list too.
    * H5 <-> GIF convertor has been added. This is available under
      tools/gifconv. The convertor supports the ability to create animated
      gifs as well.
    * Removed limitation that the data transfer buffer size needed to be
      set for datasets whose dimensions were too large for the 'all' selection
      code to handle.  Any size dimensioned datasets should be handled
      correctly now.

Supported Configuration Features Summary
========================================

    * See "Supported Configuration Features Summary" section for the HDF5
      1.4.0 release in the HISTORY.txt file.


Known Problems
==============

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output in some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executable are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * The shared library failed compilation on IRIX 6.5.
    
    * After "make install" or "make install-doc" one may need to reload
      the source from the tar file before doing another build.

    * See "Known problems" section for the HDF5 1.4.0 release in the
      HISTORY.txt file.
