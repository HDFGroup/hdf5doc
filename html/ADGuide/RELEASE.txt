            (2) Using mpt and mpich 1.2.6.
            (3) Linux 2.4 with GNU, Intel, and PGI compilers, as indicated.  
                  W or C indicates workstation or cluster, respectively.
            (4) Shared libraries are provided only for the C library, 
                except on Windows where they are provided for C and C++.

Known Problems
==============
* test/big fails sometimes with the message "Possible overlap with another
  region."  The test selects regions randomly, and this error occurs when
  two regions overlap each other; it is an bug in the test and not in
  HDF5.  Since the error is triggered by a random situation, it will
  usually disappear if the test is re-run.

* Cray SV1 fails to correctly convert between floating-point and "long double"
  for software conversion.  Problem is being investigated. SLU - 2005/03/04

* Newer SGI MIPSpro compilers (version 7.4.x) support C99 features but it
  has a "guard" statement in stdint.h that will #error and skip the rest
  of the header file if C99 option is not used explicitly.  Hardset
  $CC to c99 will resolve the problem. AKC - 2004/12/13

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command poe.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.
  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already
  in use".  HDF5 does not use sockets (except for stream-VFD).  This is
  due to problems of the poe command trying to set up the debug socket.
  Check if there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* staying around.  These are
  sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed commands.
  Ask your system administrator to clean them out.  Lastly, request IBM
  to provide a mean to run poe without the debug socket.

* Fortran subroutine h5pget_driver_f doesn't return a correct driver 
  information.

* There are two h5dump xml tests(h5dump --xml thlink.h5 and 
  h5dump --xml tmany.h5) failed on windows xp with .NET for debug and 
  debug dll. Release and Release dll work fine. 

* The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output on some platforms
  (e.g. parallel jobs, Windows) where the error messages directed to
  "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output from stdout.
  This is not an error.

* The stream-vfd test uses ip port 10007 for testing. If another
  application is already using that port address, the test will hang
  indefinitely and has to be terminated by the kill command. To try the
  test again, change the port address in test/stream_test.c to one not
  being used in the host.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system
  libraries on Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine
  with this option.
  
  It is suggested that you don't use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* The Stream VFD was not tested yet under Windows. It is not supported
  in the TFLOPS machine.

* The ./dsets tests failed in the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The hdf5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Certain platforms give false negatives when testing h5ls:
    - Cray T90IEEE give errors during testing when displaying
      some floating-point values. These are benign differences due to
      the different precision in the values displayed.
      h5ls appears to be dumping floating-point numbers correctly.

* Before building HDF5 F90 Library from source on Crays 
  replace H5Aff.f90, H5Dff.f90 and H5Pff.f90 files in the fortran/src
  subdirectory in the top level directory with the Cray-specific files
  from the site:
  ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current/src/patches/

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build HDF5 fortran 
  library, compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 and 
  fflush2.f90 complaining about exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error)

* Use --disable-shared configure flag if building with Absoft Fortran
  compiler

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  INSTALL file sections 5.7 and 5.8

* In LANL QSC, the new cc compiler has problems converting small values of
  long long (absolute values less than 1**-308) to double.  This triggers
  the test/dtypes to report failure in the
      Testing random sw long double -> double conversions
  If -ieee is used, the converted doubles spread over the range 0.0 to 1**-308.
  If -ieee is not used, the converted double values are mostly 0.0 but
  occasionally as 1**-308.  This has been reported to the system staff.
  All other tests have passed.

* The C++ library's tests fails when compiling with PGI C++ compiler.  The
  workaround until the problem is correctly handled is to use the
  flag "--instantiate=local" prior to the configure and build steps, as:
        setenv CXX "pgCC --instantiate=local"  for pgCC 5.02 and higher
        setenv CXX "pgCC -tlocal" for others

* Fortran release DLL randomly failed with compaq visual fortran 6.6c on
  windows. 

* Fortran DLL built with Intel 8.1 in .NET environment crushed the compiler,
  To build Fortran Static library with Intel 8.1 in .NET environment 
  needs manually setting the project file,
  please contact to hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu if you need to build
  fortran static library with Intel 8.1 with .NET environment.

* On at least one system, (SDSC DataStar), the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it
  for your installation.

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item
  on the command line which executes the test.  The script then
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF make files and test scripts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can
  can prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.
