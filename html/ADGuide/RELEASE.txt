INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF5-1.4.0 and
HDF5-1.4.1, and contains information on the platforms tested and
known problems in HDF5-1.4.1. For more details check the HISTORY.txt
file in the HDF5 source.

The HDF5 documentation can be found on the NCSA ftp server
(ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu) in the directory:

     /HDF/HDF5/docs/

New Features
============

   * XML output option for h5dump utility.
  
     A new option --xml to output data in XML format has been added. The
     XML output contains a complete description of the file, marked up in
     XML. 

     The XML conforms to the HDF5 Document Type Definition (DTD), which
     is available at:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.dtd

     The XML output is suitable for use with other tools, including the
     Java Tools:

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.0 Release
==================================

   * h4toh5 utility: conversion of images is fixed

     Earlier releases of the h4toh5 utility produced images that did not
     correctly conform to the HDF5 Image and Palette Specification.

     http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ImageSpec.html

     Several required HDF5 attributes are omitted, and the dataspace
     is reversed (i.e., the ht. and width of the image dataset is
     incorrectly described.)  For more information, please see:

     http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/H5Image/ImageDetails.html

   * Fixed bug with contiguous hyperslabs not being detected, causing
     slower I/O than necessary.
   * Fixed bug where non-aligned hyperslab I/O on chunked datasets was
     causing errors during I/O
   * The RCSID string in H5public.h was causing the C++ compiling problem
     because when it was included multiple times, C++ did not like
     multiple definitions of the same static variable. All occurance of
     RCSID definition are removed since we have not used it consistently
     before.
