INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF5-1.4.0 and
HDF5-1.4.1, and contains information on the platforms tested and
known problems in HDF5-1.4.1. For more details check the HISTORY.txt
file in the HDF5 source.

The HDF5 documentation can be found on the NCSA ftp server
(ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu) in the directory:

New Features
============

   * XML output option for h5dump utility.
  
     A new option --xml to output data in XML format has been added. The
     XML output contains a complete description of the file, marked up in
     XML. 

     The XML conforms to the HDF5 Document Type Definition (DTD), which
     is available at:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/DTDs/HDF5-File.dtd

     The XML output is suitable for use with other tools, including the
     Java Tools:

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.4.0 Release
==================================

   * h4toh5 utility: conversion of images is fixed

     Earlier releases of the h4toh5 utility produced images that did not
     correctly conform to the HDF5 Image and Palette Specification.

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/doc/ImageSpec.html

     Several required HDF5 attributes are omitted, and the dataspace
     is reversed (i.e., the ht. and width of the image dataset is
     incorrectly described.)  For more information, please see:

       http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/H5Image/ImageDetails.htm

   * Fixed bug with contiguous hyperslabs not being detected, causing
     slower I/O than necessary.
   * Fixed bug where non-aligned hyperslab I/O on chunked datasets was
     causing errors during I/O
   * The RCSID string in H5public.h was causing the C++ compiling problem
     because when it was included multiple times, C++ did not like
     multiple definitions of the same static variable. All occurance of
     RCSID definition are removed since we have not used it consistently
     before.

Supported Configuration Features Summary
========================================

    * See "Supported Configuration Features Summary" section for the HDF5
      1.4.0 release in the HISTORY.txt file.

Known Problems
==============

    * The h5dump tests may fail to match the expected output in some
      platforms (e.g. SP2 parallel, Windows) where the error messages
      directed to "stderr" do not appear in the "right order" with output
      from stdout.  This is not an error.

    * The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for HP-UX
      11.00 platforms.

    * The executable are always dynamic on IRIX64 6.5(64 and n32) and 
      IRIX 6.5 even if they are configured with --enable-static-exec.

    * The shared library failed compilation on IRIX 6.5.
    
    * After "make install" or "make install-doc" one may need to reload the source
      from the tar file before doing another build.

    * See "Known problems" section for the HDF5 1.4.0 release in the
      HISTORY.txt file.
