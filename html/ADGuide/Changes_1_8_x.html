<p>This document covers HDF5 releases in the HDF5 Release 1.8.x
series prior to the current release.
For each release, we list new features and changes in 
the existing HDF5 feature set,
the HDF5 application programming interface (API), and 
the command-line tools distributed with the HDF5 Library.
The intent is to note changes that application developers must be
aware of when maintaining applications or libraries 
that must work with progressively newer versions of HDF5.

This section lists interface-level changes and 
other user-visible changes in behavior 
in the transition from HDF5 Release 1.8.15 to Release 1.8.16.

    <h3>New and Changed Functions, Classes, Subroutines, Wrappers, 
        and Macros</h3>

            <dt>New HDF5 Plugin Interface (H5PL) 
                </dt>
                <dd>A new HDF5 Plugin Interface (H5PL), enabling 
                    programmatic control of dynamically loaded plugins, 
                    was introduced at HDF5 Release 1.8.15.
                    This interface was only partially documented at that time, 
                    but more complete documentation is now available:
                    <ul>

                        in <i>Advanced Topics in HDF5</i> 
                        </li>
                    <li>&ldquo;<a href="../RM/RM_H5PL.html">H5PL: 
                        Plugin Interface</a>&rdquo; 
                        in the <i>HDF5 Reference Manual</i>
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                        <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5PL.html#Plugin-SetLoadingState">
                            <code>H5PLset_loading_state</code></a>

                        <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5PL.html#Plugin-GetLoadingState">

                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </dd>

            <p />
            <dt>The following new C function has been added:
                </dt>
                <dd>This function reports whether the linked
                    version of the HDF5 Library was built 
                    with the thread-safety feature enabled.
                    <ul>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5.html#Library-IsLibraryThreadsafe">
                        <code>H5is_library_threadsafe</code></a>
                    </ul>
                    </dd>

            <p />
            <dt>The following flag has been removed:
                </dt>
                <dd><code>H5F_ACC_DEBUG</code> flag for 
                    <code>H5Fopen/create</code>
                    <font size="1"><br />&nbsp;<br /></font>
                    The flag <code>H5F_ACC_DEBUG</code> was used to provide 
                    extra debugging information for HDF Library developers.
                    This flag and the underlying functionality have been 
                    removed from the library due to disuse. 
                    The symbol remains defined since it was visible in
                    <code>H5Fpublic.h</code>, but it has been set to 
                    zero&nbsp;(<code>0</code>) and has no effect anywhere 
                    in the library.

            <dt><strong>In the C++ Interface</strong>
                </dt>

            <dt>The following features have been added:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                <li>New class <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code>
                    for the object creation property list class
                    <p />
                    The new class <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code>
                    is derived from <code>H5::PropList</code> and
                    is a baseclass of <code>H5::DSetCreatPropList</code>.  
                    Additional property list classes will be added to 
                    the library in future releases and some of those will
                    be derived from <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code>.
                    </li>
                <li>New wrappers for the C functions 
                    <code>H5P[s/g]et_attr_phase_change</code> and
                    <code>H5P[s/g]et_attr_creation_order</code>
                    <p />
                    The following wrappers were added to the class 
                    <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code> 
                    for the respective C functions:

    <h3>Library Configuration</h3>
        <dir>
        <dl>    
            <p />
            <dt>Use of thread-safety with the HDF5 High-level Library
                has been declared unsupported in the build tools: 
                Autotools and CMake.
                <br />&nbsp;
                </dt>
                <dd>The global lock used by the thread-safety mechanism 
                    is not raised to the high-level library level, 
                    making it possible that the library state could change 
                    if a context switch were to occur in a high-level library 
                    call. Because of this, the combination of thread-safety 
                    and the high-level library is officially unsupported by
                    The HDF Group.
                    <p>
                    Though this combination has never been supported in HDF5, 
                    this was not enforced by the build systems. 
                    With this release, the combination has been explicitly 
                    flagged as unsupported in Autotools and CMake, 
                    the build systems used with HDF5.
                    <p>
                    The new unsupported declaration will cause an Autotools 
                    configure step to fail if <code>--enable-threadsafe</code> 
                    and <code>--enable-hl</code> are combined unless 
                    additional options are specified (see below).
                    Since the high-level library is built by default, 
                    this means that these extra configuration options will 
                    need to be used any time <code>--enable-threadsafe</code> 
                    is selected.
                    <p>
                    To use Autotools to build an application with 
                    <code>--enable-threadsafe</code>, 
                    use one of the following approaches:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use <code>--disable-hl</code> to disable the 
                            high-level library. 
                            <i>(Recommended)</i>
                            </li>
                        <li>Use <code>--enable-unsupported</code> to build the 
                            high-level library with the thread-safety feature. 
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    To use CMake to build an application with 
                    <code>HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE=ON</code>, 
                    use one of the following approaches:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use <code>HDF5_BUILD_HL_LIB=OFF</code> 
                            to disable the high-level library. 
                            <i>(Recommended)</i>
                            </li>
                        <li>Use <code>HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED=ON</code> 
                            to build the high-level library with the 
                            thread-safety feature. 
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Since this combination is unsupported, applications 
                    using it must be carefully tested for potential 
                    thread-safety failures.

            <dt>The following new C functions have been added:
                </dt>
                <dd>Memory allocation functions that use the library&rsquo;s

                    <p />
      HDF5 filters may need to allocate or resize the buffer that is passed
      to them from the library. If the filter has been compiled separately
      from the library, it and the library may use different memory
      allocation libraries for the (re)allocation and free calls. This can
      cause heap corruption and crashes. This is particularly a problem on
      Windows since each C run-time library is implemented as a separate
      shared library, but can also show up on POSIX systems when debug or
      high-performance allocation libraries are in use.
                    <p />

      Two new functions (H5allocate_memory() and H5resize_memory()) were
      added to the HDF5 C library. These functions have the same semantics as
      malloc/calloc and realloc, respectively. Their primary purpose is to
      allow filter authors to allocate or resize memory using the same
      memory allocation library as the HDF5 library. Filter authors are
      highly encouraged to use these new functions in place of malloc,
      calloc, and realloc. They should also use the H5free_memory() call when
      freeing memory.
                    <p />

      Note that the filters provided with the library (zlib, szip, etc.) do
      not experience the problems that these new functions are intended to
      fix. This work only applies to third-party filters that are compiled
      separately from the library.

        <dl>    
            <dt><strong>In the C Interface (main library)</strong>

<!--
            <dt>The following new high-level C functions have been added:
                </dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../HL/RM_HDF5Optimized.html#H5DOwrite_chunk">
                    <code>__</code></a> 
                </ul>
                    This function ..
                    <p>
                    See &ldquo;<a 
                    href="../Advanced/DirectChunkWrite/index.html">__
                    </a>&rdquo; for additional information.
                </dd>
-->

            <p>
            <dt>The following new C functions have been added:
                </dt>
            <dd>
                To free memory allocated by HDF5 function calls:
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5.html#Library-FreeMemory">
                    <code>H5free_memory</code></a>
                    <br>
                    This function should be used to free memory that has 
                    been allocated by HDF5 API calls such as
                    <code>H5Tget_member_name</code> and 
                    <code>H5Pget_class_name</code>.
                    <p />
                    The primary value for this call is on Windows systems, 
                    where it is common for application code and the 
                    HDF5 Library to be using different C run-time 
                    libraries (CRT). Using this new call ensures that the 
                    same CRT handles both the allocation and free. 
                    <p />
                    This function can also be useful in any case where 
                    the library uses a different memory manager than the 
                    application, such as when a debug memory manager is 
                    in use or when the HDF5 Library is wrapped for use 
                    in a managed language like Python or Java.
                </ul>

            <dd>
                New configuration property for the <small>CORE</small> driver:
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetCoreWriteTracking">
                    <code>H5Pset_core_write_tracking</code></a>

                    <code>H5Pget_core_write_tracking</code></a>
                    <br>
                    With this property, the <small>CORE</small> driver,
                    <a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetFaplCore"><code>H5Pset_fapl_core</code></a>,
                    can be configured to track dirty regions in the file and 
                    write out only the changed regions on flush or close 
                    operations. 
                    Additionally, a <i>page aggregation size</i> 
                    can be set that will aggregate small writes into 
                    larger writes. For example, 
                    setting a 1 mebibyte (1 MiB) page aggregation size 
                    will logically partition the the in-memory file 
                    into 1 MiB pages that will be written out 
                    in their entirety if even a single byte is dirtied.

                    <br />
                    If the <code>name</code> parameter is passed as
                    <code>NULL</code>, then the <code>size</code>
                    parameter is ignored and the function returns the size 
                    of the buffer required to read the name
                    (not including the NULL terminator).
                    <br>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5Z.html#Compression-FilterAvail">
                    <code>H5Zfilter_avail</code></a> 
                    <br>
                    This function has been updated to correctly identify
                    <a href="../Advanced/DynamicallyLoadedFilters/HDF5DynamicallyLoadedFilters.pdf">dynamically 
                    loaded filters</a>.
                    If a filter is not found among registered filters,
                    the function now checks for dynamically loaded filters.

            <dt>Parallel I/O support:</dt>
            <dd>Parallel I/O support has been enhanced to allow collective I/O 
                on point selections.
            <p />
            <dt>Thread safety (Windows only)</dt>
            <dd>The thread-safe HDF5 library no longer leaks thread-local 
                storage resources on Windows with Win32 threads. 
                This cleanup can only be performed when the library 
                is built as a shared library, so a 
                thread-safe HDF5 static library with Win32 threads 
                is no longer supported.  
                <p />
                This change affects only Windows environments.

    <h3>New Feature: Dynamically Loaded Filters</h3>
        <dir>
            HDF5 now detects and dynamically loads external filters,
            reducing the need for an application to register custom filters 
            or for a developer building on HDF5 to compile a custom filter 
            into a customized HDF5 distribution.
            <p>

                <p>
                The HDF5 Fortran interface has been extended and
                upgraded to Fortran 2003 for this release.  

                <p>
                See &ldquo;Configure and Build Changes&rdquo; below
                for the configure options to use when building HDF5 with 
                Fortran 2003 enabled.
               
                <p>
                Features enabled in this upgrade are described in
                <a href="../fortran/NewFeatures_F2003.pdf">
                <cite>New Features in the HDF5 Fortran Library: 
                Adding Support for the Fortran 2003 Standard</cite></a> 
                (PDF only).  
                In general, the links below are to technical descriptions
                (reference manual entries, for example) of specific 
                interfaces.

                <p>
                <b>Terminology:</b>
                If the Fortran compiler in use is Fortran 2003 compliant 
                and the installed HDF5 Library was configured using both the
                <code>--enable-fortran</code> and 
                <code>--enable-fortran2003</code> flags,
                the resulting HDF5 Fortran Library is referred to below as a
                <i>Fortran 2003 environment</i>.
                Without either of the Fortran 2003 compliant compiler 
                or the <code>--enable-fortran2003</code> flag, the resulting
                HDF5 Fortran Library is referred to below as a

    <h3>Configure and Build Changes</h3>
    
        <dir>
            <code>configure</code> now uses the same flags and symbols 
            in its tests as are used to build the library.

            <p>
            To build HDF5 with the Fortran 2003 interfaces requires the use of
            two configure options:
                <br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--enable-fortran
                <font size="+1">&nbsp;</font></code>
                <br>
                <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--enable-fortran2003
                <font size="+1">&nbsp;</font></code>
                <br>
            Note that building the Fortran 2003 interfaces requires 
            a Fortran 2003-capable compiler and that 
            <code>--enable-fortran2003</code> cannot be used alone.

            <p>
            The <code>--enable-h5dump-packed-bits</code> configure option
            has been removed.  The code that this option enabled is now 
            always compiled into <code>h5dump</code>.

            <p>
            When building on Linux systems, the HDF5 Library now links
            with the <code>bsd_compat</code> library.

        </dir>

    <h3>Parallel Library and Configuration Changes</h3>

        <dir>
            
            The parallel HDF5 library now always compiles code to 
            take advantage of MPI functionalities that allow for the use 
            of complex derived datatypes during IO and that allow for
            collective IO when one or more processes do not contribute 
            to the operation. 
            <p>
            This was previously conditionally compiled into the library 
            and controlled by <code>configure</code> via the 
            <code>hdf5_cv_mpi_special_collective_io_works</code> and 
            <code>hdf5_cv_mpi_complex_derived_datatype_works</code> 
            cache values. 
            These values were preset in the <code>config/*</code> 
            files based on the compiler and/or system or could be set 
            on the configure line. 
            Support for these cache values has been removed and 
            they no longer have an effect on the compilation of the use 
            of these MPI functionalities.

<h2>Release 1.8.7 of May 2011 versus Release 1.8.6</h2>
</a>
<dir>

This section lists interface-level changes and 
other user-visible changes in behavior 
in the transition from HDF5 Release 1.8.6 to Release 1.8.7.


    <h3>New C Functions and Macros</h3>
    
        <dl>    
            <dd>Three new functions enable the caching of files opened through 
                external links.  This cache can improve the performance of 
                external links in heavy use cases:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetELinkFileCacheSize">
                        <code>H5Pset_elink_file_cache_size</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-GetELinkFileCacheSize">
                        <code>H5Pget_elink_file_cache_size</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5F.html#File-ClearELinkFileCache">
                        <code>H5Fclear_elink_file_cache</code></a></li>
                </ul>

                &nbsp;<br>
                Two new macros enable compile-time inclusion or exclusion
                of code depending on the version of the HDF5 Library 
                against which an application is to be linked:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5.html#Library-VersionGE">
                        <code>H5_VERSION_GE</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5.html#Library-VersionLE">
                        <code>H5_VERSION_LE</code></a></li>
                </ul>
        </dl>    


    <h3>C Functions with Changed Capability</h3>
    
        <dl>    
            <dd>HDF5 now allows the size of any dataspace dimension to be 
                <code>0</code> (zero).  This was previously allowed
                only if the maximum size of the dimension was unlimited.  
                Though their signatures have not changed, the range of valid
                parameter values is affected for the following functions:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5S.html#Dataspace-CreateSimple">
                        <code>H5Screate_simple</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5S.html#Dataspace-SetExtentSimple">
                        <code>H5Sset_extent_simple</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetExternal">
                        <code>H5Pset_external</code></a></li>
                </ul>
                Note that no data can be written to a dataset in which 
                the size of any dimension is set to zero.

                <br>&nbsp;<br>
                In the logging file driver, 
                implementation of the following flags has been completed:
                <code>H5FD_LOG_TIME_OPEN</code>,
                <code>H5FD_LOG_TIME_READ</code>, 
                <code>H5FD_LOG_TIME_WRITE</code>, and
                <code>H5FD_LOG_TIME_SEEK</code> 
                <br>
                Two new flags have been added: 
                <code>H5FD_LOG_NUM_TRUNCATE</code> and
                <code>H5FD_LOG_TIME_STAT</code>.
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetFaplLog">
                        <code>H5Pset_fapl_log</code></a></li>
                </ul>

                &nbsp;<br>
                HDF5 now blocks committing a datatype that cannot hold
                any data.  This currently includes
                compound datatypes with no fields and
                enumerated datatypes with no members.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5T.html#Datatype-Commit1">
                        <code>H5Tcommit1</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5T.html#Datatype-Commit2">
                        <code>H5Tcommit2</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5T.html#Datatype-CommitAnon">
                        <code>H5Tcommit_anon</code></a></li>
                </ul>
                HDF5 has long blocked creating a dataset or attribute 
                with such a datatype.

    <h3>Fortran Subroutines with Changed Capability</h3>
    
        <dl>

                <a href="../HL/RM_H5LT.html"><code>h5ltread_dataset*_f</code></a>
                subroutines have been modified to allow them to 
                create or read arrays of up to seven dimensions.  
                They had previously been limited to three dimensions.

            has been corrected to compare all attributes with common names 
            when comparing objects.  
            Previously, <code>h5diff</code> compared attributes correctly 
            only when two objects had the same number of attributes 
            and all attribute names were identical; if there was either a 
            value or name difference between two attributes, 
            subsequent attributes were not compared.

    <h3>Configure and Build Changes</h3>
    
        <dir>
            Configure now generates Makefiles that build in 
            <i>silent make mode</i> by default.  
            In this mode, compile and link lines are significantly 
            simplified for clarity. You can opt out of this default 
            with either of the following approaches:
            <ul>
                <li>Use the <code>--disable-silent-rules</code> flag at 
                    configure time to override the default and view actual 
                    compile and link lines during the build.</li>
                <li>Use the <code>make</code> command with the <code>V=1</code> 
                    option to run a verbose make. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The new configure option <code>--enable-unsupported</code> 
            can be used to stop <code>configure</code> from preventing the 
            use of unsupported configure option combinations.
            For example, use of this option enables building HDF5 with the
            <em>unsupported and untested</em> configurations of 
            C++ in a parallel environment or
            Fortran with a threadsafe library.

            <ul>
                <li><i><b>WARNING: 
                   <br>
                   Use &nbsp;
                   </i><code>--enable-unsupported</code><i> &nbsp; 
                   at your own risk!</b></i> 
                   <br>
                   This option may result in a library that does not compile 
                   or does not run as expected.</li>

            <a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-Diff"><code>h5diff</code></a>
            now compares member objects and groups recursively when

            <p>
            <a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-Ls"><code>h5ls</code></a>
            now displays object and attribute names exactly as stored in 
            the file rather than interpreting them for output.
            For example, if an attribute is named <code>\ttemp</code>
            in the file, <code>h5ls</code> will output that name as
            <code>\ttemp</code> rather than converting the leading
            <code>\t</code> to a tab.

            <a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-Repack"><code>h5repack</code></a>

            and 
            <a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-H5FC"><code>h5pfc</code></a>
            arguments have been expanded 
            to enable the user to add compiler and linker flags 
            that will take precedence over the flags from the HDF5 build.
            <p>
            The arguments <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, <code>CFLAGS</code>, 
            <code>LDFLAGS</code>, and <code>LIBS</code> have been 
            duplicated with the prefix <code>H5BLD_</code> 
            to put the flags and paths from the HDF5 build in the 
            correct places and to allow the script user to add entries in 
            <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, <code>CFLAGS</code>, 
            <code>LDFLAGS</code>, and <code>LIBS</code> that will take 
            precedence over those from the HDF5 build.  
            Changes to these entries can be made
            persistent by editing <code>CFLAGSBASE</code>, 
                <code>CPPFLAGSBASE</code>, <code>LDFLAGSBASE</code>, and 
                <code>LIBSBASE</code> near the top of the script. 
            If the change is to be temporary, the user can set 
                <code>HDF5_CFLAGS</code>, <code>HDF5_CPPFLAGS</code>, 
                <code>HDF5_LDFLAGS</code>, or <code>HDF5_LIBS</code> 
                in the environment.  
            <p>
            The new order of arguments for these scripts is as follows:
            <pre>
        $CLINKER 
        $H5BLD_CPPFLAGS 
        $CPPFLAGS 
        $H5BLD_CFLAGS

    <h3>Embedded HDF5 Library Settings Information</h3>
    
        <dl>    
            <dd>Library settings are now embedded in an HDF5 executable 
                so that an &ldquo;orphaned&rdquo; executable can be queried

                library settings used to build it.   
                The embedded settings information is the same as that
                normally found in the <code>libhdf5.settings</code> file.

    <h3>Fortran Subroutines with Changed Syntax</h3>
    
        <dl>    
            <dd>The following Fortran subroutines have changed syntax 
                in this release:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>h5lget_info_f</code></li>
                    <p>
                    The type of the parameter <code>address</code> has changed 
                    from <code>INTEGER</code> to <code>INTEGER(HADDR_T)</code>.
                    <br>
                    <i>(This note added on 13 January 2010.)</i>
                  <li><code>h5lget_info_by_idx_f</code></li>
                    <dir>
                    <code>
                    h5lget_info_by_idx_f (loc_id, group_name, index_field, order, n, &
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    link_type, f_corder_valid, corder, cset, address, val_size, &
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    hdferr, lapl_id)

                    </dir>
                <p>
                The parameters <code>link_type</code>, <code>address</code>, 
                and <code>val_size</code> have been added;
                the parameter <code>data_size</code> has been removed.

    <h3>Tools with Changed Interface or Behavior</h3>
    
        <dl>    
            <dd><a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-Diff"><code>h5diff</code></a>
                has one new option:
                <dir>
                    <code>--use-system-epsilon</code>
                <p>
                With this option, <code>h5diff</code> returns a difference
                if and only if the difference between two data values
                exceeds the system value for epsilon
                (that is, if <code>|a-b| &gt; <i>epsilon</i></code>).
                <p>
                The tool&rsquo;s default behavior has also changed; 
                without this option, the tool now checks for strict equality.
                Prior default behavior was to use an epsilon internally 
                defined in HDF5.
                <p>
                This option has no short form.
                </dir>
                <p>
            <dd><a href="../RM/Tools.html#Tools-Dump"><code>h5dump</code></a>
                has one new option and the behavior of another set of 
                options has changed:
                <dir>
                    <code>-R</code> or <code>--region</code>
                <p>
                With this option, <code>h5dump</code> prints 
                the data pointed to by a region reference.
                Without this option, <code>h5dump</code> prints 
                only the reference.
                <p>
                Usage of the subsetting parameters has changed.
                All of <code><em>START</em></code>, 
                <code><em>STRIDE</em></code>, <code><em>COUNT</em></code>, 
                and <code><em>BLOCK</em></code> now have default values.
                If those defaults are satisfactory, 
                <code>h5dump</code> no longer requires that all four 
                be specifiespecified when subsetting a dataset.
                </dir>
                <p>
        </dl>    

    <h3>Changed Library Configuration</h3>

        <dl>
            <dd>The following configuration flag is new with this release:
                    <dir>
                    <code>--disable-embedded-libinfo</code>
                    </dir>
                This flag disables the embedding of HDF5 Library settings
                in an HDF5 executable.

        <a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-GetPreserve">H5Pget_preserve</a> </pre>

        The original role of these functions is now  
        part of the core HDF5 Library functionality.
        <p>     


    <h3>Changed File Installation</h3>
        The file <code>libhdf5_fortran.settings</code> is no longer
        installed with the HDF5 Library;
        the original content of that file is now included in 
        <code>libhdf5.settings</code>.
        <p>     


    <h3>Changed Library Configuration</h3>
        It is no longer necessary to manually set an SZIP library path in
        <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> 
        when building HDF5 with shared SZIP libraries;
        <code>configure</code> will determine the correct path 
        from the <code>--with-szlib</code> flag, 
        prepending it to and exporting <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
        <p>     
        Note that if an SZIP library path is set in a user-supplied 
        <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, in an existing script, for example, 
        that does not necessarily need to be changed; 
        <code>configure</code> will prepend the SZIP library path 
        extracted from <code>--with-szlib</code> 
        to the user-supplied <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.

<h2>Release 1.8.0 versus Release 1.6.x</h2> 
</a>

<dir>

HDF5 Release 1.8.0 is a major release with several new features
and a variety of bugfixes, optimizations, and 
portability enhancements. 
<p>
See the document 
&ldquo;<a href="WhatsNew180.html">What&rsquo;s New in HDF5 1.8.0</a>&rdquo; 
for a high-level overview of the new functionality in this release.
The following pages assume a familiarity with that overview.
<p>

This section provides details of the API-level changes that have been made 
in the transition to HDF5 Release 1.8.0 from the Release 1.6.<i>x</i> series.


    <h3>API Compatibility Macros with Associated Renamed and New Functions</h3>
	<dl>
	  <dt>Release 1.8.0 introduces API compatibility macros
            designed to facilitate application migration.
            These macros are intended to facilitate developer management 
            of a clean, step-by-step migration from an older HDF5 Library 
            to the new release;
            they can also be used to enable older applications to use the
            new library without requiring that the application be rewritten.
            See <a href="../RM/APICompatMacros.html"><cite>API Compatibility 
            Macros in HDF5</cite></a> for a full description.

            <p>
            Macros are identified in reference manual function indexes 
            by an <i>italic</i> typeface.
            <p>
            The new macros and the new and old functions to which they 
            may be mapped are as follows:

        and may eventually be removed from the HDF5 distribution 
        and from the <cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite>.
        A Release 1.6.x compatibility mode is provided 
        enabling these and other Release 1.6.x compatibility
        features, but is available only if the HDF5 Library is 
        configured with the default settings or with the flag 
        <code>--with-default-api-version=v16</code>.
        Release 1.8.0 also provides macros that can be mapped
        selectively to 1.6.x and 1.8.0 function versions
        according to the needs of a user application.
        The backward compatibility mode is enabled in the 
        Release 1.8.0 binaries distributed by NCSA.
        See <href="../RM/APICompatMacros.html">API Compatibility 
        Macros in HDF5</a> for full details.

    <h3>Virtual File Driver Removed</h3>

	The stream virtual file driver (<code>H5FD_STREAM</code>)
        have been removed in this release.
        This affects the functions <code>H5Pset_fapl_stream</code>
        and <code>H5Pget_fapl_stream</code> and 
        the constant <code>H5FD_STREAM</code>.
        <p>
        This virtual file driver will remain available at
        <a href="http://hdf5-addons.origo.ethz.ch/">
        <code>http://hdf5-addons.origo.ethz.ch/</code></a>.
        Note that as of this writing, this transition is still 
        in progress; the necessary integration tools may not be 
        available when HDF5 Release 1.8.0 first comes out.

	<p>
        C API:
        <dir>
        <dl>
        <dt><code>H5FD_t</code>
                <dd>In this struct, the field <code>fileno[2]</code>

                  <br>
                  The struct is otherwise unchanged.
                  <br>&nbsp;
        <dt><code>H5Z_class_t</code>
                <dd>This struct contains three new fields:

    <h3>Changed <small>ENUM</small>s</h3>
    
        The following enumerated datatypes used by the library 
        are discontinued in this release:

	<p>
        <dir>
        <dl>
        <dt><code>H5E_major_t</code>
                  &mdash; Major error numbers
        <dt><code>H5E_minor_t</code>
                  &mdash; Minor error numbers
                <dd>HDF5 error codes have changed from the <small>ENUM</small> 
                  format used in earlier releases to an identifier format.
                  As <small>ENUM</small>s, error codes were constants 
                  defined at compile time; as identifiers, error codes 
                  are defined at runtime, in the same manner as HDF5
                  object identifiers (file, dataset, group, etc.).
                  <p>
                  Under normal circumstances, this change should be transparent 
                  to user applications.

    The HDF5 source code, as distributed to users and developers, 
    contains two files that will be of interest to readers of this 
    document.  Both files are located at the top level of the 
    source code tree and are duplicated here for your reference:
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="RELEASE.txt" target="ExtWin">RELEASE.txt</a>
        <dd>Technical notes regarding the release, including 
            new features and the changes since the last release, 
            notes regarding new or revised utilities,
            notes regarding alternative language APIs (Fortran90, C++),
            bugs fixed since the last release,
            platforms on which the release has been tested, and
            known problems. 
            This is the file commonly known as "the release notes."
      <p>
      <dt><a href="HISTORY.txt" target="ExtWin">HISTORY.txt</a>
        <dd>A release-by-release history of the HDF5 Library.  
            This file is a compiled set of the release notes
            (i.e., the RELEASE.txt files) from prior releases.
