<h1>New Features in HDF5 Release 1.8.0
and Format Compatibility Considerations</h1>
</div>

<a name="FormatCompatIntro">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

This document discusses backward/forward file format compatibility, 
features introduced in HDF5 Release 1.8.0, and corresponding APIs 
that may trigger these features and corresponding incompatibility.

<p>
Forward compatibility relates to the ability of an older HDF5 Library 
to read files created by a newer HDF5 Library. An older library should 
be able to read objects that are known to that library in a file 
created by Release 1.8.0.  This document includes a list of features 
that are designed to create no forward compatibility problems; 
a forward compatibility failure with one of these features is a bug.

<p>
Backward compatibility relates to the ability of a newer HDF5 Library 
to read files created by an older HDF5 Library.  
E.g., if HDF5 Release 1.8.0 is unable to read files created by 
Release 1.6.5, that is a backward compatibility failure.  
An HDF5 design criterion is that the HDF5 Library is always 
backwardly compatible.  A backward compatibilty failure is a bug.

<p>
The table below lists features introduced in HDF5 Release 1.8.0 
and the objects they may act on, 
then indicates combinations in which compatibility conflicts 
might arise.  Some features will always create objects 
or write data that will be incompatible with older versions of the library; 
others will do so only under certain circumstances.

<p>
<strong>
Related document
</strong>
<p>
<a href="../RM/APICompatMacros.html"><cite> API Compatibility Macros 
in HDF5</cite></a> discusses 
    configurable function macros that were introduced in 
        HDF5 Release 1.8.0 to facilitate the adaptation of applications
        to that and future releases,
    criteria for selecting specific configurations, and
    steps required to set them up.

<p>
Whereas <cite>New Features in HDF5 Release 1.8.0 and Format Compatibility 
Considerations</cite> discusses format compatibility issues to consider
when applications using HDF5 Release 1.8.0 (or a later release) will create 
files that might have to be read using older versions of the HDF5 Library,
<cite>API Compatibility Macros in HDF5</cite> discusses an approach 
to resolving API compatibility issues when moving an application 
to that release (or a later release).


<p>
<strong>
Reading the table
</strong>
<p>
New features in HDF5 Release 1.8.0 
are listed across the top of the table. 

<p>
Objects in an HDF5 file that features might affect format compatibility 
are listed on the left-hand side.  If the object is printed in bold, 
the symbols across the row indicate the effect that the feature 
has when it acts directly on that object.  
Associated with several objects are one or more objects 
indented to the right and printed in normal typeface; 
ripple effects of a feature may affect these objects 
when the feature acts on the related bold-faced object.

<p>
Consider the intersection of the <i>Attribute</i> lines and 
<i>Attribute and object headers</i> features.  
The symbols on the <i>Attribute</i> line indicate the effect of the 
feature when it acts on an attribute;  
the symbols on the <i>Object</i> line, immediately below, 
indicate the effect of the feature on an HDF5 object 
when the feature acts on an attribute attached to that object.  
For example, the table indicates that attribute creation order 
can be tracked and indexed with the HDF5 Release 1.8.0 Library 
only with new-format attributes, and those attr
ibutes will not be readable by older libraries.  
The table further indicates that an object 
to which such attributes are attached (a dataset, for example) 
will therefore be unreadable by an older HDF5 library.

<h3>2. A Summary Table

<font size=-1>New Features in HDF5 Release 1.8.0 and Their Impact on Format Compatibility</font>

The table below lists new features in HDF5 Release 1.8.0 
that may create forward-compatibility conflicts.
Objects created or modified with any of these features 
may be inaccessible via HDF5 Libraries prior to Release 1.8.0.

<li> Under the new implementation, 
links may be stored as messages in an object header 
or in a type-2 B-tree in the group's local heap.
<br>
<li> By default, a datatype is stored as a message 
in the object header; a named datatype, 
which may be shared by several datasets, 
is stored as an independent object in the file.
<br>
<li> Several new features do not involve new or changed APIs.
<br>
<li> The following elements are stored (or can be stored; 
see notes 2 and 3) as messages in an  object header.
<br>
<li> These APIs create coordinated sets of objects and metadata.  
Though individual elements are quite likely to be accessible 
through an older HDF5 library, that library will have 
no means of understanding the relationships among the various pieces.
<br>
<li> Compatibility problems will arise only if an application 
or the HDF5 Library crashed without properly closing a file with 
which this functionality was being used.

<h3>3. Features that may create (or are known to create) 
    compatibility concerns</h3>

    The following HDF5 Release 1.8.0 features may create 
    new HDF5 objects that cannot be read by an older 
    HDF5 Library or modify existing objects such that 
    they cannot be read by an older HDF5 Library.

        <dt>
        Object creation using <i>latest available format</i>, specified
        via the <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code> function.
        <dd>
            When <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code> is called with the
            <code>low</code> argument equal to <code>HDF_LIBVER_LATEST</code>,
            new objects are created using the latest available format versions.
        
            <p>
            This is a file access property, so this object creation behavior 
            can be set for any existing file, and can vary according to 
            application needs each time a file is opened.  
        
            <p>
            Functions:
            <br>  
                <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds( hid_t fapl_id, H5F_libver_t low, H5F_libver_t high )</code> 
            <br>
                <code>H5Pget_libver_bounds( hid_t fapl_id, H5F_libver_t* low, H5F_libver_t* high )</code>
            <p>
            Default behavior:  If <code>H5Pset_libver_bounds</code> is not called with <code>low</code> equal to 
            <code>HDF_LIBVER_LATEST</code>, then the HDF5 Library provides the greatest-possible format
            compatibility. It does this by creating objects with the earliest possible format that 
            will handle the data being stored and accommodate the action being taken.

        <dd>
            Compact-or-indexed groups enable much-compressed link

            The efficiency and performance impacts are most noticeable 
            at the extremes:  all unnecessary overhead is eliminated 
            for groups with zero members; groups with 
            tens of thousands of members may see as much as 
            a 100-fold performance gain.  
        
            <p>
            This new group implementation also enables user-defined

            to an HDF5 object in a different HDF5 file.  
            In part to provide a model for application developers, 
            external links are implemented as an example of a 
            user-defined link.

        NULL dataspaces (<code>H5Screate</code>) (3)
        <dd>
            The <code>H5S_NULL</code> dataspace class allows an application 
            to use <code>H5Screate</code> to define a dataset or 
            attribute dataspace with no elements.
        
            <p>
            This feature is implemented through the addition 
            of a NULL dataspace, <code>H5S_NULL</code>, 
            to the set of valid dataspace classes.

<h3>4. Features that are designed to create no compatibility concerns</h3>

    The following HDF5 Release 1.8.0 features are designed 
    to create no forward compatibilty conflicts; 
    an older HDF5 Library should always be able to read 
    and manipulate objects that they create or modify.
