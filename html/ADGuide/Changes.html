<!--   - interface changes and                                   -->

<!-- *********************************************************** -->


<p>This document is designed to help developers maintain 
HDF5-based applications as they are used with successive releases
of HDF5.
To that end, this document lists the changes at each release that
a maintenance developer needs to be aware of:
<ul>
    <li>New or changed features or tools
    <li>Syntax and behavioral changes in the existing application 
        programming interface (the API) 
    <li>Certain types of changes in configuration or build processes 
</ul></p>

<p>Bugfixes and performance enhancements in the C library 
are automatically picked up by the C++ and Fortran libraries.  
The Java library will pick up the same bugfixes and enhancements
at its next subsequent release as it is always built with
the latest released version of the C library.

<p>The release notes also list changes made to the library, but these 
notes tend to be more at a more detail oriented level. The release 
notes may include new features, bugs fixed, supported configuration 
features, platforms on which the library has been tested, and known 
problems. The release note files are listed below and can be found 
at the top level of the HDF5 source code tree in the release_docs 
directory of the distributed HDF5 source code.</p>

<p><strong>Are you porting an existing application from 
HDF5 Release 1.6.x to HDF5 Release 1.8.x?</strong>
<br />
If you are porting an existing application 
from any HDF5 version in the Release 1.6.x series 
to any version in the Release 1.8.x series, 
refer to &ldquo;<a href="../ADGuide/WhatsNew180.html">What's New in 
HDF5 1.8.0</a>&rdquo;.
This document, with the documents linked in its introduction,
provide a guide to the changes introduced in the transition 
from the 1.6.x series to HDF5 Release 1.8.0
and discussions of various compatibility issues.</p>

            <p>
            <dt>The behavior of the following C function has been changed:
                </dt>
            <dd>The function <code>H5Pset_core_write_tracking</code>
                has been modified to enforce the limitation that the
                value of the <code>page_size</code> parameter
                cannot equal <code>0</code> (zero):
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetCoreWriteTracking">
                    <code>H5Pset_core_write_tracking</code></a>
                </ul>
                </dd>

            <p>
            <dt>The following performance optimization has been implemented 
                in the Parallel HDF5 library:
                </dt>
            <dd>The algoritm for writing chunk fill values for new datasets 
                has been optimized to write out all chunk fill values 
                collectively in a single MPI-IO call.  This was previously 
                done independently by rank 0 (zero) one block at a time. 
                This optimization should produce a significant performance
                improvement when creating chunked datasets in parallel,
                most notably when chunk dimensions are relatively small.
                This optimization will be evident in use of the following
                function:
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5D.html#Dataset-Create">
                    <code>H5Dcreate</code></a>

            <p>
            <dt><strong>In the high-level library C Interface</strong>
                </dt>

            <dt>High-level HDF5 interfaces now ensure that strings are 
                null-terminated and will not overflow a buffer.
                </dt>
                <dd>In several high-level functions, the type from the file 
                    was previously re-used as the memory type and
                    no check is made to ensure that a string was actually 
                    null-terminated.
                    <p>
                    All high-level functions now 
                    check for <code>NULL</code> pointers; 
                    verify that a received a string is null-terminated; and 
                    verify that the string will not overflow the buffer.
                    The minimum length of the buffers is now used in 
                    <code>strncmp</code> to avoid overflow.

    The HDF5 source code, as distributed to users and developers, 
    contains two files that will be of interest to readers of this 
    document.  Both files are located at the top level of the 
    source code tree and are duplicated here for your reference:
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="RELEASE.txt" target="ExtWin">RELEASE.txt</a>
        <dd>Technical notes regarding the release, including 
            new features and the changes since the last release, 
            notes regarding new or revised utilities,
            notes regarding alternative language APIs (Fortran90, C++),
            bugs fixed since the last release,
            platforms on which the release has been tested, and
            known problems. 
            This is the file commonly known as "the release notes."
      <p>
      <dt><a href="HISTORY.txt" target="ExtWin">HISTORY.txt</a>
        <dd>A release-by-release history of the HDF5 Library.  
            This file is a compiled set of the release notes
            (i.e., the RELEASE.txt files) from prior releases.
