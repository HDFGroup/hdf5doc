<!--   - interface changes and                                   -->

<!-- *********************************************************** -->


<p>This document is designed to help developers maintain 
HDF5-based applications as they are used with successive releases
of HDF5.
To that end, this document lists the changes at each release that
a maintenance developer needs to be aware of:
<ul>
    <li>New or changed features or tools
    <li>Syntax and behavioral changes in the existing application 
        programming interface (the API) 
    <li>Certain types of changes in configuration or build processes 
</ul></p>

<p>Bugfixes and performance enhancements in the C library 
are automatically picked up by the C++ and Fortran libraries.  
The Java library will pick up the same bugfixes and enhancements
at its next subsequent release as it is always built with
the latest released version of the C library.

<p>The release notes also list changes made to the library, but these 
notes tend to be more at a more detail oriented level. The release 
notes may include new features, bugs fixed, supported configuration 
features, platforms on which the library has been tested, and known 
problems. The release note files are listed below and can be found 
at the top level of the HDF5 source code tree in the release_docs 
directory of the distributed HDF5 source code.</p>

to any version in the Release 1.8.x series, 
refer to &ldquo;<a href="../ADGuide/WhatsNew180.html">What's New in

in the transition from HDF5 Release 1.8.14 to Release 1.8.15.

    <h3>New and Changed Functions, Classes, Subroutines, Wrappers,

        <dir>
        <dl>    
            <dt><strong>In the C Interface (main library)</strong>
                </dt>


            <dt>The following new C functions have been added:
                </dt>
                <dd>Memory allocation functions that use the library&rsquo;s 
                    allocator.
<!--
                    <p />
      HDF5 filters may need to allocate or resize the buffer that is passed
      to them from the library. If the filter has been compiled separately
      from the library, it and the library may use different memory
      allocation libraries for the (re)allocation and free calls. This can
      cause heap corruption and crashes. This is particularly a problem on
      Windows since each C run-time library is implemented as a separate
      shared library, but can also show up on POSIX systems when debug or
      high-performance allocation libraries are in use.
                    <p />

      Two new functions (H5allocate_memory() and H5resize_memory()) were
      added to the HDF5 C library. These functions have the same semantics as
      malloc/calloc and realloc, respectively. Their primary purpose is to
      allow filter authors to allocate or resize memory using the same
      memory allocation library as the HDF5 library. Filter authors are
      highly encouraged to use these new functions in place of malloc,
      calloc, and realloc. They should also use the H5free_memory() call when
      freeing memory.
                    <p />

      Note that the filters provided with the library (zlib, szip, etc.) do
      not experience the problems that these new functions are intended to
      fix. This work only applies to third-party filters that are compiled
      separately from the library.

                    A new <code>DataType</code> constructor takes a

                    and <code>H5Object</code>
                    are no longer appropriate after the data member
                    <code>id</code> was moved from <code>IdComponent</code>
                    to the sub-classes in previous releases:

    &lt;Classname&gt;(const hid_t h5_id);

    &lt;Classname&gt;(const &lt;Classname&gt;& original);
                    </pre>
                    The copy constructors have been no-ops and are removed 
                    in this HDF5 Release 1.8.15.  
                    The other constructors will be removed in 
                    HDF5 Release 1.10 and are expected to be removed
                    from HDF5 Release 1.8.17 if their removal causes 
                    no problems.

    The HDF5 source code, as distributed to users and developers, 
    contains two files that will be of interest to readers of this 
    document.  Both files are located at the top level of the 
    source code tree and are duplicated here for your reference:
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="RELEASE.txt" target="ExtWin">RELEASE.txt</a>
        <dd>Technical notes regarding the release, including 
            new features and the changes since the last release, 
            notes regarding new or revised utilities,
            notes regarding alternative language APIs (Fortran90, C++),
            bugs fixed since the last release,
            platforms on which the release has been tested, and
            known problems. 
            This is the file commonly known as "the release notes."
      <p>
      <dt><a href="HISTORY.txt" target="ExtWin">HISTORY.txt</a>
        <dd>A release-by-release history of the HDF5 Library.  
            This file is a compiled set of the release notes
            (i.e., the RELEASE.txt files) from prior releases.
