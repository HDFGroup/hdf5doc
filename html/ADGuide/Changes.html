<!--   - interface changes and                                   -->

<!-- *********************************************************** -->


<p>This document is designed to help developers maintain 
HDF5-based applications as they are used with successive releases
of HDF5.
To that end, this document lists the changes at each release that
a maintenance developer needs to be aware of:
<ul>
    <li>New or changed features or tools
    <li>Syntax and behavioral changes in the existing application 
        programming interface (the API) 
    <li>Certain types of changes in configuration or build processes 
</ul></p>

<p>Bugfixes and performance enhancements in the C library 
are automatically picked up by the C++ and Fortran libraries.  
The Java library will pick up the same bugfixes and enhancements
at its next subsequent release as it is always built with
the latest released version of the C library.

<p>The release notes also list changes made to the library, but these 
notes tend to be more at a more detail oriented level. The release 
notes may include new features, bugs fixed, supported configuration 
features, platforms on which the library has been tested, and known 
problems. The release note files are listed below and can be found 
at the top level of the HDF5 source code tree in the release_docs 
directory of the distributed HDF5 source code.</p>

            <dt>New HDF5 Plugin Interface (H5PL) 
                </dt>
                <dd>A new HDF5 Plugin Interface (H5PL), enabling 
                    programmatic control of dynamically loaded plugins, 
                    was introduced at HDF5 Release 1.8.15.
                    This interface was only partially documented at that time, 
                    but more complete documentation is now available:

                        </li>

                </dd>

            <p />
            <dt>The following new C function has been added:
                </dt>
                <dd>This function reports whether the linked
                    version of the HDF5 Library was built 
                    with the thread-safety feature enabled.
                    <ul>
                    <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5.html#Library-IsLibraryThreadsafe">
                        <code>H5is_library_threadsafe</code></a>
                    </ul>
                    </dd>

            <p />
            <dt>The following flag has been removed:
                </dt>
                <dd><code>H5F_ACC_DEBUG</code> flag for 
                    <code>H5Fopen/create</code>
                    <font size="1"><br />&nbsp;<br /></font>
                    The flag <code>H5F_ACC_DEBUG</code> was used to provide 
                    extra debugging information for HDF Library developers.
                    This flag and the underlying functionality have been 
                    removed from the library due to disuse. 
                    The symbol remains defined since it was visible in
                    <code>H5Fpublic.h</code>, but it has been set to 
                    zero&nbsp;(<code>0</code>) and has no effect anywhere 
                    in the library.

                <dd>
                <li>New class <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code>
                    for the object creation property list class
                    <p />
                    The new class <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code>
                    is derived from <code>H5::PropList</code> and
                    is a baseclass of <code>H5::DSetCreatPropList</code>.  
                    Additional property list classes will be added to 
                    the library in future releases and some of those will
                    be derived from <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code>.
                    </li>
                <li>New wrappers for the C functions 
                    <code>H5P[s/g]et_attr_phase_change</code> and
                    <code>H5P[s/g]et_attr_creation_order</code>
                    <p />
                    The following wrappers were added to the class 
                    <code>H5::ObjCreatPropList</code> 
                    for the respective C functions:

    <h3>Library Configuration</h3>
        <dir>
        <dl>    
            <p />
            <dt>Use of thread-safety with the HDF5 High-level Library
                has been declared unsupported in the build tools: 
                Autotools and CMake.
                <br />&nbsp;
                </dt>
                <dd>The global lock used by the thread-safety mechanism 
                    is not raised to the high-level library level, 
                    making it possible that the library state could change 
                    if a context switch were to occur in a high-level library 
                    call. Because of this, the combination of thread-safety 
                    and the high-level library is officially unsupported by
                    The HDF Group.
                    <p>
                    Though this combination has never been supported in HDF5, 
                    this was not enforced by the build systems. 
                    With this release, the combination has been explicitly 
                    flagged as unsupported in Autotools and CMake, 
                    the build systems used with HDF5.
                    <p>
                    The new unsupported declaration will cause an Autotools 
                    configure step to fail if <code>--enable-threadsafe</code> 
                    and <code>--enable-hl</code> are combined unless 
                    additional options are specified (see below).
                    Since the high-level library is built by default, 
                    this means that these extra configuration options will 
                    need to be used any time <code>--enable-threadsafe</code> 
                    is selected.
                    <p>
                    To use Autotools to build an application with 
                    <code>--enable-threadsafe</code>, 
                    use one of the following approaches:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use <code>--disable-hl</code> to disable the 
                            high-level library. 
                            <i>(Recommended)</i>
                            </li>
                        <li>Use <code>--enable-unsupported</code> to build the 
                            high-level library with the thread-safety feature. 
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    To use CMake to build an application with 
                    <code>HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE=ON</code>, 
                    use one of the following approaches:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use <code>HDF5_BUILD_HL_LIB=OFF</code> 
                            to disable the high-level library. 
                            <i>(Recommended)</i>
                            </li>
                        <li>Use <code>HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED=ON</code> 
                            to build the high-level library with the 
                            thread-safety feature. 
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Since this combination is unsupported, applications

                </dt>

<!--
                    <p />
      HDF5 filters may need to allocate or resize the buffer that is passed
      to them from the library. If the filter has been compiled separately
      from the library, it and the library may use different memory
      allocation libraries for the (re)allocation and free calls. This can
      cause heap corruption and crashes. This is particularly a problem on
      Windows since each C run-time library is implemented as a separate
      shared library, but can also show up on POSIX systems when debug or
      high-performance allocation libraries are in use.
                    <p />

      Two new functions (H5allocate_memory() and H5resize_memory()) were
      added to the HDF5 C library. These functions have the same semantics as
      malloc/calloc and realloc, respectively. Their primary purpose is to
      allow filter authors to allocate or resize memory using the same
      memory allocation library as the HDF5 library. Filter authors are
      highly encouraged to use these new functions in place of malloc,
      calloc, and realloc. They should also use the H5free_memory() call when
      freeing memory.
                    <p />

      Note that the filters provided with the library (zlib, szip, etc.) do
      not experience the problems that these new functions are intended to
      fix. This work only applies to third-party filters that are compiled
      separately from the library.

                    to <code>MPI_COMM_SELF</code> that shuts down the 
                    HDF5 Library when <code>MPI_COMM_SELF</code>
                    is destroyed, that is, on <code>MPI_Finalize</code>. 
                    This should fix several issues that users see when they 
                    forget to close HDF5 objects before calling
                    <code>MPI_Finalize()</code>.

    The HDF5 source code, as distributed to users and developers, 
    contains two files that will be of interest to readers of this 
    document.  Both files are located at the top level of the 
    source code tree and are duplicated here for your reference:
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="RELEASE.txt" target="ExtWin">RELEASE.txt</a>
        <dd>Technical notes regarding the release, including 
            new features and the changes since the last release, 
            notes regarding new or revised utilities,
            notes regarding alternative language APIs (Fortran90, C++),
            bugs fixed since the last release,
            platforms on which the release has been tested, and
            known problems. 
            This is the file commonly known as "the release notes."
