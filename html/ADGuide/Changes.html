<!--   - interface changes and                                   -->

<!-- *********************************************************** -->


<p>This document is designed to help developers maintain 
HDF5-based applications as they are used with successive releases
of HDF5.
To that end, this document lists the changes at each release that
a maintenance developer needs to be aware of:
<ul>
    <li>New or changed features or tools
    <li>Syntax and behavioral changes in the existing application 
        programming interface (the API) 
    <li>Certain types of changes in configuration or build processes 
</ul></p>

<p>The release notes also list changes made to the library, but these 
notes tend to be more at a more detail oriented level. The release 
notes may include new features, bugs fixed, supported configuration 
features, platforms on which the library has been tested, and known 
problems. The release note files are listed below and can be found 
at the top level of the HDF5 source code tree in the release_docs 
directory of the distributed HDF5 source code.</p>

<p><strong>Are you porting an existing application from 
HDF5 Release 1.6.x to HDF5 Release 1.8.x?</strong>
<br />
If you are porting an existing application 
from any HDF5 version in the Release 1.6.x series 
to any version in the Release 1.8.x series, 
refer to &ldquo;<a href="../ADGuide/WhatsNew180.html">What's New in 
HDF5 1.8.0</a>&rdquo;.
This document, with the documents linked in its introduction,
provide a guide to the changes introduced in the transition 
from the 1.6.x series to HDF5 Release 1.8.0
and discussions of various compatibility issues.</p>

This section lists interface-level changes and 
other user-visible changes in behavior 
in the transition from HDF5 Release 1.8.13 to Release 1.8.14.


    <h3>New and Changed Functions, Classes, Subroutines, Wrappers, 
        and Macros</h3>
        <dir>
        <dl>    
            <dt><strong>In the C Interface (main library)</strong>
                </dt>

            <dt>The following new C functions have been added:
                </dt>
            <dd>To enable a single write or read call to operate 
                on multiple datasets:
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5D.html#Dataset-WriteMulti">
                    <code>H5Dwrite_multi</code></a>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5D.html#Dataset-ReadMulti">
                    <code>H5Dread_multi</code></a>
                <li>Related struct: <code>H5D_rw_multi_t</code>
                </ul>
                </dd>

            <p>
            <dt>The behavior of the following C function has been changed:
                </dt>
            <dd>The function <code>H5Pset_core_write_tracking</code>
                has been modified to enforce the limitation that the
                value of the <code>page_size</code> parameter
                cannot equal <code>0</code> (zero):
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetCoreWriteTracking">
                    <code>H5Pset_core_write_tracking</code></a>
                </ul>
                </dd>

            <p>
            <dt>The following performance optimization has been implemented 
                in the Parallel HDF5 library:
                </dt>
            <dd>The algoritm for writing chunk fill values for new datasets 
                has been optimized to write out all chunk fill values 
                collectively in a single MPI-IO call.  This was previously 
                done independently by rank 0 (zero) one block at a time. 
                This optimization should produce a significant performance
                improvement when creating chunked datasets in parallel,
                most notably when chunk dimensions are relatively small.
                This optimization will be evident in use of the following
                function:
                <ul>
                <li><a href="../RM/RM_H5D.html#Dataset-Create">
                    <code>H5Dcreate</code></a>
                </ul>
                </dd>

            <p>
            <dt><strong>In the C++ Interface</strong>
                </dt>

            <dt>The following new features have been added 
                to the C++ interface:
                </dt>

                <dd>New methods:
                    <ul>
                    <li>None
                    </ul>
                    </dd>

                <p>
            <dt>The following changes have been made in the C++ interface:
                <dd>Changed methods
                      <ul>
                      <li><code>none</code> None
                      </ul>
                      </dd>
                <p>
                <dd>Changed defaults
                      <ul>
                      <li>None
                      </ul>
                      </dd>
                <p>
                <dd>Other changes
                      <ul>

            <p>
            <dt><strong>In the Fortran Interface</strong>

            <dt>The following new Fortran subroutines have been added:
