HDF5 Technical Notes


This file contains information regarding the history of the documents 
that make up the "HDF5 Technical Notes." 

"HDF5 Technical Notes" was created from previously-existing documents in 
May 2000.  At that time, files were copied from the top level of the HDF5 
CVS repository into the TechNotes/ subdirectory.  The original files, with 
which the CVS history was associated, remained in the top-level directory 
of the document set until July 2005.  At that time, a separate HDF5 
documentation repository, hdf5doc/, was set up under Subversion and the 
HDF5 document set was extracted from the development branch of the HDF5 
CVS repository, hdf5/.

The following files, original documents from which "HDF5 Technical Notes" 
was created, were removed from the top level of the HDF5 document set in
the new repository as Revision 1350 in July 2005.

	Removed from hdf5doc/html/ at rev 1350:

	Big.html                IOPipe.html
	CodeReview.html         Lib_Maint.html
	Coding.html             MemoryManagement.html
	compat.html             storage.html
	ExternalFiles.html      Version.html

	pipe1.gif               pipe4.gif
	pipe1.obj               pipe4.obj
	pipe2.gif               pipe5.gif
	pipe2.obj               pipe5.obj
	pipe3.gif               version.gif
	pipe3.obj               version.obj

"HDF5 Technical Notes," 'svn checkout' a copy of the hdf5doc/ repository 
at Revision 1349.
