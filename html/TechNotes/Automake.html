<p><h2><u>How to:</u><h2></p>

<p><h3>Change a Makefile</h3></p>

<p><h3>Add a source file to an existing program or library</h3></p>

<p><h3>Add a simple test</h3></p>

<p><h3>Add a test with multiple sources</h3></p>

<p><h3>Add a new directory</h3></p>

<p><h3>Add a program that is only compiled in parallel</h3></p>

<p><h3>Change a program's name when it is compiled in parallel</h3></p>

<p><h3>Add a new library</h3></p>

<p><h3>Change the library's API</h3></p>
<br>

<p><h4>Changing a Makefile</h4></p>

<p>Suppose you need to make a minor change to the Makefile in the test directory
(<code>hdf5/test/Makefile</code>).  You have checked out hdf5 from the CVS repository into
<code>~/scratch/hdf5</code>.  You want to build the library in a directory named
<code>~/scratch/build</code>.<br>
First, edit the Makefile.am in the source tree.  You must make any changes in the Makefile.am,
not the Makefile, since the Makefile is automatically generated.</p>

<p><code>cd ~/scratch/hdf5/test<br>
vi Makefile.am</code></p>

<p>Now, go to the root of the source tree and run the reconfigure script, which updates the
source tree.  It will create a new Makefile.in in the test directory with your changes.</p>

<p><code>cd ~/scratch/hdf5<br>
./bin/reconfigure</code></p>

<p>After running <code>bin/reconfigure</code>, you will want to test your change.  Go to
<code>~/scratch/build</code> and run <code>configure</code>.</p>

<p><code>cd ~/scratch/build<br>

../hdf5/configure<br>

make check</code></p>

<p>Configure generates Makefiles from the Makefiles.in in the source tree.  The dependencies are:</p>

<p><code>Makefile.am -&gt; (bin/reconfigure) -&gt; Makefile.in -&gt; (configure) -&gt; Makefile</code></p>

<p>Reconfigure should also be used when any change is made to configure.in.</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Adding a source file to an existing program or library</h4></p>

<p>Suppose you want to add the source file <code>h5testfoo.c</code> to the HDF5 test
library in the test directory.  You open up <code>test/Makefile.am</code> in your
favorite text editor and scroll down until you see the line:</p>

<p><code>libh5test_la_SOURCES=h5test.c testframe.c</code></p>

<p>Just add <code>h5testfoo.c</code> to the list of sources.  You're done!<br>
Now run <code>bin/reconfigure</code> to create a new Makefile.in from the Makefile.am you just
edited.</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Adding a simple test</h4></p>

<p>Suppose you want to create a new test executable named <code>newtest</code> with one
source file, <code>newtest.c</code>.  You open up <code>test/Makefile.am</code> and find
the line</p>

<p><code>TEST_PROG=testhdf5 lheap ohdr ...</code></p>

<p>Just add <code>newtest</code> to the list of programs.  That's it!  Automake will by
default guess that your program <code>newtest</code> has one source file named
<code>newtest.c</code>.<br>
Now run <code>bin/reconfigure</code> to update the Makefile.in.</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Adding a slightly more complicated test</h4></p>

<p>Suppose you want to create a new test executable named <code>newertest</code> with
several source files.  You open up <code>test/Makefile.am</code> as before and find the line</p>

<p><code>TEST_PROG=testhdf5 lheap ohdr ...</code></p>

<p>Add <code>newertest</code> to the list of programs.<br>
Now you need to tell Automake how to build newertest.  Add a new line below
<code>TEST_PROG</code>:</p>

<p><code>newtest_SOURCES = source1.c source2.c source3.c</code></p>

<p>You don't need to mention header files, as these will be automatically detected.<br>
Now run <code>bin/reconfigure</code> to update the Makefile.in.</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Adding a directory</h4></p>

<p>To add the directory for a new tool, <code>h5merge</code>, go to the Makefile.am
in the tools directory (the parent directory of the directory you want to add).
Find the line that reads</p>

<p><code>SUBDIRS=lib h5dump...</code></p>

<p>Add <code>h5merge</code> to this list of subdirectories.<br>
Now you probably want to create a Makefile.am in the h5merge directory.  A good starting
point for this Makefile.am might be the sample Makefile.am in the config directory
(<code>config/Makefile.am.blank</code>).  Alternately, you could copy the Makefile.am
from another directory.<br>
Once you have your new Makefile.am in place, edit <code>configure.in</code> in the root
directory.  Near the end of the file is a list of files generated by configure.
Add <code>tools/h5merge/Makefile.in</code> to this list.<br>
Now run <code>bin/reconfigure</code>.  This will update configure and generate a Makefile.in in the
<code>tools/h5merge</code> directory.  Don't forget to add both the Makefile.am and the Makefile.in to
CVS, and to update the manifest!.</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Adding a program that is only compiled in parallel</h4></p>

<p>Suppose you only want to compile a program when HDF5 is configured to run in
parallel--for example, a parallel version of h5repack called <code>h5prepack</code>.
Open up the h5repack Makefile.am<br>
The simple solution is:</p>

<p><code>if BUILD_PARALLEL_CONDITIONAL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H5PREPACK=h5prepack<br>
endif</code></p>

<p>Now the variable <code>$H5PREPACK</code> will be &quot;h5prepack&quot; if parallel is
enabled and &quot;&quot; if parallel is disabled.  Add <code>$H5PREPACK</code> to the list of
programs to be built:</p>

<p><code>bin_PROGRAMS=h5repack $(H5PREPACK)</code></p>

<p>Add sources for this program as usual:</p>

<p><code>h5prepack_SOURCES=...</code></p>

<p>Don't forget to run <code>bin/reconfigure</code> when you're done!</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Changing a program's name when it is compiled in parallel</h4></p>

<p>Automake conditionals can be a very powerful tool.  Suppose that instead of building
two versions of h5repack during a parallel build, you want to change the name of
the tool depending on whether or not HDF5 is configured to run in parallel--you
want to create either h5repack or h5prepack, but not both.<br>
Open up the h5repack Makefile.am and use an automake conditional:</p>

<p><code>if BUILD_PARALLEL_CONDITIONAL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H5REPACK_NAME=h5prepack<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H5REPACK_NAME=h5repack<br>
endif<br>
bin_PROGRAMS=$(H5REPACK_NAME)</p>

<p>Now you only build one program, but the name of that program changes.  You still need
to define sources for both h5repack and h5prepack, but you needn't type them out twice if
they are the same:</p>

<p><code>h5repack_SOURCES=...<br>
h5prepack_SOURCES=$(h5repack_SOURCES)</code></p>

<p>Don't forget to run <code>bin/reconfigure</code> when you're done!</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Adding a new library</h4></p>

<p>Suppose you want to add a new library to the HDF5 build tree, libfoo.  The procedure for
building libraries is very similar to that for building programs:</p>

<p><code>lib_LTLIBRARIES=libfoo.la<br>
libfoo_la_SOURCES=sourcefoo.c sourcefootwo.c </code></p>

<p>This library will be installed in the lib directory when a user types
"<code>make install</code>".<br>
You might instead be building a convenience library for testing purposes (like
<code>libh5test.la</code>) and not want it to be installed.  If this is the case, you
would type</p>

<p><code>check_LTLIBRARIES=libfoo.la</code><br>
instead of<br>
<code>lib_LTLIBRARIES=libfoo.la</code></p>

<p>To make it easier for other directories to link to your library,
you might want to assign its path to a variable in all HDF5 Makefiles.  You can
make changes to all Makefiles by editing <code>config/commence.am</code> and adding a line
like</p>

<p><code>LIBFOO=$(top_builddir)/foo/src/libfoo.la</code></p>

<p><code>config/commence.am</code> is textually included in all Makefiles.am when automake
processes them.<br>
As always, if you change a Makefile.am or <code>config/commence.am</code>, don't forget to run
<code>bin/reconfigure</code>.</p>
<br>

<p><h4>Changing HDF5's API</h4></p>

<p>If you have added or removed a function from HDF5, or if you have changed a function
signature, you must indicate this by updating the file <code>lt_vers.am</code> located in
the <code>config</code> directory.<br>
If you have changed the API at all, increment <code>LT_VERS_INTERFACE</code> and set
<code>LT_VERS_REVISION</code> to zero.<br>
If you have added functions but not altered or removed existing ones, also increment
<code>LT_VERS_AGE</code>.<br>
If instead you have altered or removed any functions, reset <code>LT_VERS_AGE</code> to
zero.</p>
