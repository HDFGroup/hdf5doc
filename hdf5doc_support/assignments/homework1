What makes a reference manual entry useful?


Continuing our discussion of reference manual entries from last week's 
HDF5 meeting, here's an assignment for next week.  Please send your 
"answers" to Ruth by 5pm on Thursday, October 23rd.  She will compile 
them anonymously and use them to drive the discussion at the developer 
meeting on Friday, Oct 24th.

As we saw during the initial discussion, we all have a different idea 
of what makes a "good" entry.  Our goal is to try and learn from all 
those different ideas and guide the RM entries toward something that 
we can all find informative -- and that our users will find informative 
as well.

In the directory assignments/ under 
http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/hdf5doc/trunk/hdf5doc_support
you will find the current RM entries for 3 functions:  
	H5Dread
	H5open
	H5set_free_list_limits    
To read the entries, checkout the repository: 
	svn checkout http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/hdf5doc/trunk/hdf5doc_support
In assignments/, open H5Dread.html, H5open.html, and 
H5set_free_list_limits.html locally in your browser.    


There are three parts to the assignment.  Complete what you can and 
send it to Ruth by 5PM on Thursday, Oct 23rd.   

Spend up to 2 hours on the assignment if possible, and charge the time
to GMQS documentation.

Part 1: (spend no more than 1 hour)
The three attached spreadsheets ask a series of questions for each of 
the three entries.  Please answer those and return to Ruth.  
(These spreadsheets can also be found in the assignments/ directory 
mentioned above.)

Part 2: (spend remaining time, as needed, on this part)
For the RM entry you found to be the "best", please reformat it into 
the new style discussed last week, using the attached template.  
Also make changes to improve the wording, add new information, rearrange 
content, etc. so that it is a "top-notch" RM entry.   If your desired 
changes don't match the template, go with your preferred format.
(The template can also be found as templates/H5function_template.html 
in the hdf5doc_support/ repository that you checked out earlier.)

Send the reformatted entry, and any questions/problems you had while 
doing the work to Ruth.  Think about why you made the changes you did to
the entry and send those (or be willing to discuss them at the meeting or 
individually).

Also, track and send the amount of time you spent on this entry.

Part 3: (do part 3 if you have any time left)
For the RM entry you found to be the "worst" - repeat the instructions 
given in part 2, but for this "worst case."
