The issue addressed here comes up every 5 to 10 years.  The following 
notes were compiled and are recorded here to save replicating research
efforts at each event.

This document is maintained in two places; both copies should be kept
up to date.

Issue
-----
Several files in the HDF5 source code (in bin/, config/, m4/, and 
possibly elsewhere) were originally created and distributed by other 
individuals or organizations and remain under their control to varying 
extents.  From time to time, a question arises asking whether the 
copyright and license terms of these files are compatible with those 
of various HDF products. 

This issue was investigated as an HDF5 issue, but it applies generally 
to HDF products.

[Original JIRA issue: HDFFV-8505 The COPYING file in the bin folder 
should indicate that there are files in that folder that are 
copyrighted by others.]

Analysis
--------
Upon file-by-file review, it does not appear that any originator's 
terms require that The HDF Group change its copyright and license 
statements:
   -– Files from the Free Software Foundation and the X Consortium 
      contain language that essentially gives permission to distribute 
      those files in the manner that The HDF Group distributes them.
   -– Another file, created by Noah Friedman, has been placed in the 
      public domain.

In each case, all that is required is that the distributed files 
retain the creator's original statements.  That requirement has been 
met in all cases.

Conclusions
-----------
The decision is that no action is required at this time.

There are, however, some points that we should monitor to ensure 
that HDF products remain in compliance:
   -- Review any new included files.
   -- Review changes in already-included files (if and only if we 
      adopt those changes).
   -- Monitor the evolution of HDF product copyright and license
      statements.
