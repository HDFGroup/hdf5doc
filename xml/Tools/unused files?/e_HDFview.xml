				<p>There is also a visual tool, HDFview, that can be used by a user who
        prefers to work with a grachic interface. While the command-line utilities are
        distributed with the HDF5 library, HDFview is distributed separately:<xref format="html" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/" scope="external"><?xm-replace_text http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/?></xref>.
      </p>
				<p>HDVFview is suitable for a user wishes to browse a file and can used
        to extract raw data from the file. It is not scriptable, however, which might
        make it awkward when working with many different datasets or files.
