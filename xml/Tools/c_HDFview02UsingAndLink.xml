    <p>There is also a visual tool, HDFview, that can be used by a user who
      prefers to work with a grachic interface. While the command-line utilities are
      distributed with the HDF5 library, HDFview is distributed separately:<xref
      format="html" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/"
      scope="external"><?xm-replace_text http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/?></xref>.
      
    </p> 
    <p>HDVFview is an excellent choice when a user wishes to browse a file and
      can be used to extract raw data from the file. It is not scriptable, however,
      which may become time consuming when working with many different datasets or
      files.
