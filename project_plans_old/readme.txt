The purpose of the project_plans directory is to hold plans for the doc team 
for the software specified by the sub-directory. For example, plans for 
the documentation effort for HDF5 release 1.8.x can be stored in the hdf5_1_8 
directory. 

We should probably use Word to generate project plan files. Keeping track 
of comments by reviewers is easier in Word. 

If we use Word, we should manage the versions of each file manually. This 
can be done by changing the date on the file and then add the file to the 
repository. Use this file name convention: FileNameYYMMDD.docx. We do not 
need a version for tiny differences. We do not need to check the files in 
very often.
